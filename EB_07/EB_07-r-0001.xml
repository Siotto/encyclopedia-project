   <p><label>R,or r</label>, a liquid consonant, being the seventeenth letter of 5 our alphabet. Its sound is formed by a guttural ex-? trusion of breath vibrated through the mouth, with a sort of ’ quivering motion of the tongue drawn from the teeth, and canulated with the tip a little elevated towards the palate. In Greek words it is frequently aspirated with an h after it, as in rhapsody, rhetoric, and so forth ; otherwise it is always followed by a vowel at the beginning of words and syllables.</p>
   <p>In the notes of the ancients, R. or RO. signifies Roma, R. C. Romana civitas; R. G. C. ret gereruhe causa ; R. F. E. D. rede factum et dictum; R. G. F. regis filius; R. P. res publica, or Romani principes, and R. R. R. F. F. F. res Romana met ferro, fame, flamma. Used as a numeral, R anciently stood for 80; and with a dash over it thus k, for 80,000 ; but the Greek r, p, with a small mark over it, signified 100; with the same mark under it, it denoted 1000 X 10 ; thus p, signifies 100,000. In the Hebrew numeration 1 denoted 200; and with two horizontal points over it 1000x200; thus'i=200,000. In the prescriptions of physicians, R or R stands for recipe, that is, “ take.”</p>
