   <p><label>RAAB</label>, a town of Lower Hungary, capital of Javérin, with a caſtle and a biſhop's fee. It is a ſtrong frontier bulwark againſt the Turks, and has two bridges, one over a double ditch, and another that leads towards Alba Regalis. The Surrounding country is plain, and there</p>
   <p>there is nothing that ſeems to command it but a ſmall hill at ſome diſtance, which is undermined and may be blown up. It was taken by Amurath III with the loſs of 20,000 men; but was ſurpriſed ſoon after by Count Palfi, who killed all the Turks that were found therein. It is ſeated at the confluence of the rivers Rab and Rabnitz, not far from the Danube, 32 miles weſt of Gran, and 55 ſouth-eaſt of Vienna. E. Long. 17. 25. N. Lat. 47. 48,</p>
