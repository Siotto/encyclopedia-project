   <p><h3>RAABE, HEDWIG</h3> (1844-1905), German actress, was born in Magdeburg on the 3rd of
      December 1844, and at the age of fourteen was playing in the company of the Thalia theatre,
      Hamburg. In 1864 she joined the German Court theatre at St Petersburg, touring about Germany
      in the summer with such success that in 1868 she relinquished her Russian engage- ment to
      devote herself to starring. In 1871 she married Albert Niemann (b. 1831), the operatic tenor.
      She excelled in classical ro1es like Marianne in Goetheâ€™s Geschwister and Franziska in Minna
      von Barnhelm. It was she who first played Ibsen in Berlin. She died on the 21st of April
      1905.</p>
