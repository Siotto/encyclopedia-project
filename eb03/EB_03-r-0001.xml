Its found is formed by a guttural extruſion of the breath vibrated through the mouth, with a fort of quivering motion of the tongue drawn from the teeth, and canulated with the tip a little elevated towards the palate. In Greek words it is frequently aſpirated with an h after it, as in rhapſody, rhetoric, &amp;c. otherwiſe it is always followed by a vowel at the beginning of words and ſyllables.</p>
