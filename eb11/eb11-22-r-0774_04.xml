In the first case the word is an adaptation of O.Nor. râs , a cognate form in O.E. being raês , rush, onset; while the O.E. descendant reese was frequently used in medieval poetry. The particular use of the word for a swift current of water running through a narrow channel, e.g . the Race of Alderney, and for the water conducted in an artificial channel to a point where its power is to be used, as in “ mill-race,” may be due to the O.Fr. raz or raze , probably of Breton origin. Tbe second word, an ethnical or national stock, comes from Fr. rase, adapted from Ital. razzo , cf. Span. raza. It has been referred to an O.H.G. reiza, line, mark, cognate with Eng. “write,” i.e. the line marking descent. </p></div>
