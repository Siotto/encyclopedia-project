    <p><label> RADIO LARIA, </label>so called by E. Haeckel in 1862 (Polycystina, by C. G.
        Ehrenberg, 1838), the name given to Marine Sarcodina, in which the cytoplasmic body gives
        off numerous fine radiating pseudopods (rarely anastomosing) from its surface, and is
        provided with a chitinous “ central capsule,” surrounding the inner part which encloses the
        nucleus, the inner and outer cytoplasm communicating through either one or three apertures
        or numerous pores in the capsule. The extracapsular cytoplasm is largely transformed into a
        gelatinous substance (“ calymma ”), through which a granular network of plasm passes to form
        a continuous layer bearing the pseudopods at the surface; this gelatinous layer is full of
        large vacuoles, “ alveoli,” as in other pelagic Sarcodina (Heliozoa, q.v.), Globigerinidae,
        &amp;c., among Foraminifera (tf.r.). The protoplasm may contain oil-globules,
        pigment-grains, reserve-grains and crystals. There is frequently a skeleton present, either
        of silica (pure or containing a certain amount of organic admixture), or of “ acanthin ”
        (possibly a proteid, allied to vitellin, but regarded by W. Schewiakoff as a hydrated
        silicate of calcium and aluminium); never calcareous or arenaceous. The skeleton may consist
        of spicules, isolated or more or less compacted, or form a latticed shell, which, in
        correlation with the greater resistance of its substance, is of lighter and more elegant
        structure than in the Foraminifera. The alveoli contain a liquid; which, as shown by Brandt,
        is rich in carbon dioxide, and in proportion to its abundance may become much lighter than
        sea-water; and possibly the gelatinous substance of the calymma is also lighter than the
        medium. In Acantharia the protoplasm at the base </p>
    <p> of the projecting spines is often differentiated into a bundle of fibres converging on to
        the spines some way up (distally); these, comparable to the myoncmes of Infusoria (?.?.),
        &amp;c., and termed “ myophrisks ”, possibly serve to drag outwards the surface and so
        extend it, with concurrent dilatation of the alveoli, and lower the specific gravity of the
        animal. In this group also a thick temporary flagellum “ sarcoflagellum ” may be formed,
        apparently by the coalescence of a number of pseudopodia. The pigmented mass or “ phaeodium
        ” in the ectoplasm of Phaeodaria appears to be an excretory product, formed within the
        central capsule and passing immediately outwards; a similar uniform deposit of pigmented
        granules occurs in the Colloid species, Thalassicolla nucleate. The wall of the central
        capsule is simple in the Spumellaria, but formed of two layers in the Nassellaria and
        Phaeodaria. In the Nassellaria the oscule is simply a perforated area, and a cone of
        differentiated fibres in the intracapsular cytoplasm has its base on it: it is termed the
        “porocone,” and the fibres may possibly be muscular (myonemes). In Phaeodaria, the inner
        membrane at each oscule is prolonged through the outer into a tube (“proboscis”): the outer
        membrane of the principal oscule forms a large radially</p>
    <p> striated circular plate, the “ astropyle,” or “ operculum.” The innermost shell of some with
        concentric shells may lie within the central capsule, or even within the nucleus; this is
        due to the growth of these organs after the initial shell is formed, so that they pass out
        by lobes through the latticed openings of the embryonic shell, which lobes ultimately
        coalesce outside the embryonic chamber, and so come finally to invest it (fig. in. 17). In
        some, a symbiosis occurs with Zooxanthella, Brandt, a Flagellate of the group
        Chrysomadineae, which in the resting state inhabits the extracapsular cytoplasm growing and
        dividing freely therein, and only (under study) becoming free and flagellate on the death of
        the host (fig. in. 4» 6-13)· The Silicoflagellata or Dictyochidae, also possessing a
        vegetable colouring matter, but with a skeleton of impure silica (like that of Phaeodaria),
        may pass some of their lives in symbiosis with Radiolaria.</p>
    <p> Living Radiolaria were first observed and partially described by W. J. Tilcsius in 1803-6
        and 1814, by W. Baird in 1830, and by C. G. Ehrenberg in 1831, as luminous organisms in the
        sea; F. J. F. Meyen in 1834 recognized their animal character and the siliceous nature of
        their spicules. Ehrenberg a little later described a large number of Nassellarian skeletons
        under the</p>
    <p> name of Polycystina (1838), but without more than a very slight knowledge of a few living
        forms. T. H. Huxley in 1851 made the first adequate study of the living animal, and was
        followed by Joh. Mtiller in the same decade. E. Haeckel began his publications in 1862, and
        in two enormous, abundantly illustrated, systematic works, besides minor publications, has
        dealt exhaustively with the cytology, classification, and distribution of the class. Next in
        value come the contributions of Richard Hertwig (largely developmental), besides those of L.
        Cienkowsky, Karl Brandt and A. Borgert, while to F. Dreyer and V. Hacker we owe valuable
        studies on the physical relations of the skeleton.</p>

    <p> The following passages may be repeated here from Sir E. Ray Lankester’s article “ Protozoa ”
        in the 9th edition of this Encyclopaedia:— </p>
    <p> “ The important differences in the structure of the central capsule of different Radiolaria
        were first shown by Hertwig, who also discovered that the spines of the Acanthometridea
        consist not of silica but of an organic compound (but see above). In view of this latter
        fact and of the peculiar numerical and architectural features of the Acanthometrid skeleton,
        it seems proper to separate them altogether from the other Radiolaria. The Peripylaea may be
        regarded as the starting-point of the Radiolarian pedigree, and have given rise on the one
        hand to the Acanthometridea, which </p>

        and on the other hand to the Monopylaea and Phaeodaria, which have modified the capsule but
        retained the siliceous skeleton.</p>
    <p> " The occasional total absence of any siliceous or acanthi nous skeleton does not appear to
        be a matter of classificatory importance, since skeletal elements occur in close allies of
        those very few forms which are totally devoid of skeleton. Similarly it does not appear to
        be a matter of great significance that some forms (Polycyttaria) form colonies, instead of
        the central capsules separating from one another after fission has occurred.</p>
    <p> "It is important to note that the skeleton of silex or acanthin does not correspond to the
        shell of other Sarcodina, which appears rather to be represented by the membranous central
        capsule. The skeleton does, however, appear to correspond to the spicules of Heliozoa, and
        there is an undeniable affinity between such a form as Clathrulina and the Sphaerid
        Peripylaea (such as Heliosphaera, fig. in. 14). The Radiolaria are, however, a very strongly
        marked group, definitely separated from all other Sarcodina by the membranous central
        capsule sunk in their protoplasm. Their differences inter se do not affect their essential
        structure. The variations in the chemical composition of the skeleton and in the perforation
        of the capsule do not appear superficially. The most obvious features in which they differ
        from one another relate to the form and complexity of the skeleton, a part of the organism
        so little characteristic of the group that it may be wanting altogether. It is not known how
        far the form-species and form-genera which have been distinguished in such profusion by
        Haeckel as the result of a study of the skeletons are permanent (t.e. relatively permanent)
        physiological species. There is no doubt that very many are local and conditional varieties,
        or even merely stages of growth, of a single Protean species. The same remark applies to the
        species discriminated among the shell-bearing Reticulana. It must not be supposed, however,
        that less importance is to be attached to the distinguishing and recording of such forms
        because we are not able to assert that they are permanent species.</p>
    <p> " The streaming of the granules of the protoplasm has been observed in the pseudopodia of
        Radiolaria as in those of Heliozoa and Reticularia; it has also been seen in the deeper
        protoplasm; and granules have been definitely seen to pass through the pores of the central
        capsule from the mtracapsular to the extracapsular proto-</p>
    <p> Clasm. A feeble vibrating movement of the pseudopodia has een occasionally^noticed.</p>
    <p> " The production of swarm-spores has been observed only in 'Aeanthometra and in the
        Polycyttaria and Thalassicollidae, and only in the two latter groups have any detailed
        observations been made. Two distinct processes of swarm-spore production have been ^
        observed by Cienkowski, confirmed by Hertwig,—distinguished by the character of the'
        resulting spores, ^which are called 1 crystalligerous * and ' isospores * (fig. in. 15) in
        the one case, and ' dimorphous ' or * anisospores * in the^ other (fig. in. 16). In both
        processes the nucleated protoplasm within the central capsule breaks up by a more or less
        regular cell-division into small</p>
    <p> Fieces, the details of the process differing a little in the two cases. </p>
    <p> n those individuals which produce crystalligerous swarm-spores, each spore encloses a small
        crystal (fig. 1 u. 15). On the other hand, in those individuals which produce dimorphous
        swarm-spores, the contents of the capsule (which in both instances are set free by its
        natural rupture) are seen to consist of individuals of two sizes, * megaspores ’ and 1
        microspores/ neither of which contain crystals (fig. ill. 16). The further development of
        the spores has not been observed in either case. Both processes have been observed in the
        same species, and it is suggested that there is an alternation of sexual and asexual
        generations, the crystalligerous spores developing directly into adults, which in their turn
        produce in their central capsules dimorphous swarm-spores (megaspores and microspores),
        which in a manner analogous to that observed in the Volvocinean Flagellata copulate
        (permanently fuse) with one another (the larger with the smaller) before proceeding to
        develop. The adults resulting from this process would, it is suggested, produce in their
        turn crystalligerous swarm-spores. Unfortunately we have no observations to support this
        hypothetical scheme of a life-history. </p>
    <p> “ Fusion or conjugation of adult Radiolaria, whether preliminary to swarm-spore-production
        or independently of it, has not been observed—this affording a distinction between them and
        Heliozoa. </p>
    <p> “ Simple fission of the central capsule of adult individuals, preceded of course by nuclear
        fission, and subsequently of the whole protoplasmic mass, has been observed in several
        genera of Acan-tharia and Phaeodaria, and is probably a general method of reproduction in
        the group. In Spumellaria it gives rise to colonial ‘ Polycyttarian ’ forms when the
        extracapsular protoplasm does not divide. </p>
    <p> “ The siliceous shells of the Radiolaria are found abundantly in certain rocks from
