Educated privately, he entered the artillery in Cologne, but defective eyesight compelled him to leave the army. He then entered the public service at Coblenz, and in 1845 was appointed burgomaster of Weyerbusch. Here he was so successful that in 1848 he was transferred in a like capacity to Flammersfeld, and in 1852 to Heddersdorf. Raiffeisen devoted himself to the improvement of the social condition of the cultivators of the soil, and did good work in the planning of public roads and in other ways. The distress of the years 1846-47, the causes of which he discerned in the slight amount of credit obtainable by the small landed proprietors, led him to seek for a remedy in co-operation, and at Heddersdorf and at Weyerbusch he founded the first agricultural co-operative loan banks ( Darleknskassenverein ). These banks were called after him, and their foundation resulted in a widespread system of land banks, supported by the government. In 1865 the state of his health compelled him to retire, but he continued to take an interest in the movement he had originated, and in 1878 he founded at Neuwied a periodical, Das landwirtschaftliche Genossen-schaftsblatt. He died on the 1 ith of March 1888. </p><p> Among Raiffeisen's writings are, Die Darleknskassenvereine als Mittel zur Abhilfe (Neuwied, 1866; new ed., 1887^; Anleitung zur Gesch채fts- und Buchf체hrung l채ndlichen Spar - und Darlehnskassenvereine (new ed., 1896); and Kurze Anleitung zur Gr체ndung von Darlehnskassenvereinen (new ed., 1893).
