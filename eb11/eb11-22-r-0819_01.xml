    <p><label> RAILWAYS</label>. Railways had their origin in the tramways (&lt;7.t&gt;.) or
        wagon-ways which at least as early as the middle of the 16th century were used in the
        mineral districts of England round Newcastle for the conveyance of coal from the pits to the
        river Tyne for shipment. It may be supposed that originally the public roads, when worn by
        the cartage of the coal, were repaired by laying planks of timber at the bottom of the ruts,
        and that then the planks were laid on the surface of special roads or ways<ref
            xml:id="r0819-1" target="n1">1</ref><note xml:id="n0819-1" n="1"> " Another thing that
            is remarkable is their way-leaves; for, when men have pieces of ground between the
            colliery and the river, they sell leave to lead coals over their ground ” (Roger
            North).</note> formed between the collieries and the river. “ The manner of the
        carriage/* says Lord Keeper North in 1676, “ is by laying rails of timber . . . exactly
        straight and parallel, and bulky carts are made with four rowlets fitting these rails,
        whereby the carriage is so easy that one horse will draw down four or five chaldrons of
        coals ” (from 10·6 to 13-2 tons). The planks were of wood, often beech, a few inches wide,
        and were fastened down, end to end, on logs of wood, or “ sleepers/* placed crosswise at
        intervals of two or three feet. In time it became a common practice to cover them with a
        thin sheathing or plating of iron, in order to add to their life; this expedient caused more
        wear on the wooden rollers of the wagons, and, apparently towards the middle of the 18th
        century, led to the introduction of iron wheels, the use of which is recorded on a wooden
        railway near Bath in 1734. But the iron sheathing was not strong enough to resist buckling
        under the passage of the loaded wagons, and to remedy this defect the plan was tried of
        making the rails wholly of iron. In 1767 the Colebrookdale Iron Works cast a batch of iron
        rails or plates, each 3 ft. long and 4 in. broad, having at the inner side an upright ledge
        or flange, 3 in. high at the centre and tapering to a height of 2\ in. at the ends, for the
        purpose of keeping the flat wheels on the track. Subsequently, to increase the strength, a
        similar flange was added below the rail. Wooden sleepers continued to be used, the rails
        being secured by spikes passing through the extremities, but about 1793 stone blocks also
        began to be employed—an innovation associated with the name of Benjamin Outram, who,
        however, apparently was not actually the first to make it. This type of rail (fig. 1) was
        known as the plate-rail, tramway-plate or barrow-way-plate—names which are preserved in the
        modern term “ platelayer ” applied to the men who lay and maintain the permanent way of a
        railway.</p>
    <p> Another form of rail, distinguished as the edge-rail, was first used on a line which was
        opened between Loughborough and Nanpantan in 1789. This line was originally designed as a “
        plateway ” on the Outram system, but objections were raised to rails with upstanding ledges
        or flanges being laid on the turnpike road which was crossed at Loughborough on the level.
        In other cases this difficulty was overcome by paving or “ cause-the road up to the level of
        the top of the flanges,· but</p>
    <p> on this occasion William Jessop, of the Butterley Iron Works, near Derby, proposed to get
        over it by laying down two plates of iron, perfectly flat and level with the road but each
        having on its outside a groove } in. wide and f in. deep to control extra guiding wheels
        which were to be of somewhat larger diameter than the bearing wheels and to be affixed to
        them. The rest of the line was laid with what were substantially plate-rails placed on their
        edge instead of flat. These were cast in 3 ft. lengths, of a double-flanged section, and for
        the sake of strength they were “ fish-bellied ” or deeper in the middle than at the ends. At
        one end of each rail the flange spread out to form a foot which rested on a cross sleeper,
        being secured to the latter by a spike passing through a central hole, and above this foot
        the rail was so shaped as to form a socket into which was fitted the end of the next rail.
        Each length was thus fastened to a sleeper at one end, while at the other it was socketed
        into the end of its fellow. This method, however, was not found satisfactory: the projecting
        feet wefe liable to be broken off, and in 1799 or 1800 Jessop abandoned them, using instead
        separate cast-iron sockets or chairs, which were fastened to the sleepers and in which the
        rails were supported in an upright position. In the first instance he proposed to place the
        guiding wheels outside the bearing wheels, and the Nanpantan line was laid on this plan with
        a width of 5 ft. between the guide wheels; but before it was opened he decided not only to
        cast the guiding wheels and bearing wheels in one piece but also to put the former inside
        the rails, arguing that with this arrangement the edge-rails themselves would keep the
        wheels in position on the axles, whereas with that first contemplated fastenings would have
        heen required for them (fig. 2)* Jessop thus produced what was virtually the flanged wheel
        of to-day, having the flanges inside the rails, and further, it is said, established what
        has become the standard gauge of the world, 4 ft. 8£ in., or 5 ft. minus the width of two of
        his rails.</p>
    <p> These two systems of constructing railways— the plate-rail and the edge-rail—continued to
        exist side by side until well on in the 19th century.</p>
    <p> In most parts of England the plate-rail was preferred, and it was used on the Surrey iron
        railway, from Wandsworth to Croydon, which, sanctioned by parliament in 1801, was finished
        in 1803, and was the first railway available to the public on payment of tolls, previous
        lines having all been private and reserved exclusively for the use of their owners.</p>
    <p> In South Wales again, where in 1811 the railways in connexion with canals, collieries and
        iron and copper works had a total length of nearly 150 miles, the plate-way was almost
        universal. But in the north of England and in Scotland the edge-rail was held in greater
        favour, and by the third decade of the century its superiority was generally established.
        The manufacture of the rails themselves was gradually improved. By making them in longer
        lengths a reduction was effected in the number of joints— always the weakest part of the
        fine; and another advance consisted in the substitution of wrought iron for cast iron,
        though that material did not gain wide adoption until after the patent for an improved
        method of rolling rails granted in 1820 to John Birkinshaw, of the Bedlington Ironworks,
        Durham. His rails were wedge-shaped in section, much wider at the top than at the bottom,
        with the intermediate portion or web thinner still, and he recommended that they should be
        made 18 ft. long, even suggesting that several of them might be welded together end to end
        to form considerable lengths. They were supported on sleepers by chairs at intervals of 3
        ft., and were fish-bellied between the points of support. As used by George Stephenson on
        the Stockton &amp; Darlington and Whits table &amp; Canterbury lines they weighed 28 lb per
        yard. On the Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway they were usually 12 ft. or 15 ft. long and
        weighed 35 lb to the yard, and they were fastened by iron wedges to chairs weighing 15 or 17
        lb each. The chairs were</p>
    <p> in turn fixed to the sleepers by two iron spikes, half-round wooden cross sleepers being
        employed on embankments and stone blocks 20 in. square by 10 in. deep in cuttings. The
        fish-bellied rails, however, were found to break near the chairs, and from 1834 they began
        to be replaced with parallel rails weighing 50 lb to the yard. </p>
    <p> The next important development in rail design originated in America, which, for the few
        lines that had been laid up to 1830, remained content with wooden bars faced with iron. In
        that year Robert Livingston Stevens (1787-1856), devised for the Camden &amp; Amboy railway
        a rail similar as to its top to those in use in England, but having a flat base or foot by
        which it was secured to the sleepers by hook-headed spikes, without chairs (fig· 3); he had
        to get the first lot of these rails, which were 15 ft. long and weighed 36 lb to the yard,
        manufactured in England, since there were then no mills in America able to roll them. This
        type, which is often known as the Vignoles rail, after Charles'Blacker Vignoles (1793-1875),
        who re-invented it in England in 1836, is in general use in America and on the continent of
        Europe. The bridge-rail (fig. 4)—so called because it was first laid on bridges—was
        supported on continuous longitudinal sleepers and held down by bolts passing through the
        flanges, and was employed by I. K. Brunei on the Great Western railway, where, however, it
        was abandoned after the line was converted from broad to standard gauge in 1892. In the
        double-headed rail (fig. 5), originated by Joseph Locke in 1837, and first laid on the Grand
        Junction railway, the two tables were equal. This rail was more easily rolled than others,
        and, being reversible, was in fact two rails in one. But as it was laid in cast iron chairs
        the lower table was exposed to damage under the hammering of the traffic, and thus was
        liable to be rendered useless as a running surface. In consequence the bull-headed rail
        (fig. 6) was evolved, in which the lower table was made of smaller size and was intended
        merely as a support, not as a surface to be used by the wheels. There was a waste of metal
        in these early rails owing to the excessive thickness of the vertical web, and subsequent
        improvements have consisted in adjusting the dimensions so as to combine strength with
        economy of metal, as well as in the substitution of steel for wrought iron (after the
        introduction of the Bessemer process) and in minute attention to the composition of the
        steel employed. </p>
    <p> It was found, naturally, that the rails would not rest in their chairs at the joints, but
        were loosened and bruised at the ends by the blows of the traffic. The fish-joint was
        therefore devised in 1847 by W. Bridges Adams, the intention being by “ fishing ” the joints
        to convert the rails into continuous beams. In the original design two chairs were placed,
        one under each rail, a few inches apart, as in fig. 7. The joint was thus suspended between
        the two chairs, and two keys of iron, called “ fishes,” fitting the side channels of the
        rails, were driven in on each side between the chairs and the rails. In subsequent
        modifications the fishes were, as they continue to be, bolted to and through the rails, the
        sleepers being placed rather further apart and the joint being generally suspended between
        them. </p>
    <p> The iron tramway or railway had been known for half a </p>
    <p> century and had come into considerable use in connexion with collieries and quarries before
        it was realized that for the carriage of general merchandise it might prove a serious
        competitor to the canals, of which a large mileage had been constructed in Great Britain
        during that period. In the article on “Railways” in the Supplement to the Encyclopaedia
        Britannica , published in 1824, it is said: “It will appear that this species of inland
        carriage [railways] is principally applicable where trade is considerable and the length of
        conveyance short; and is chiefly useful, therefore, in transporting the mineral produce of
        the kingdom from the mines to the nearest land or water communication, whether sea, river or
        canal. Attempts have been made to bring it into more general use, but without success; and
        it is only in particular circumstances that navigation, with the aid either of locks or
        inclined planes to surmount the elevations, will not present a more convenient medium for an
        extended trade.” It must be remembered, however, that at this time the railways were nearly
        all worked by horse-traction, and that the use of steam had made but little progress.
        Richard Trevithick, indeed, had in 1804 tried a high-pressure steam locomotive, with smooth
        wheels, on a plate-way near Merthyr Tydvil, but it was found more expensive than horses;
        John Blenkinsop in 1811 patented an engine with cogged wheel and rack-rail which was used,
        with commercial success, to convey coal from his Middleton colliery to Leeds; William Hedley
        in 1813 built two locomotives—Puffing Billy and Wylam Dilly—for hauling coal from Wylam
        Colliery, near Newcastle; and in the following year George Stephenson’s first engine, the
        Blucher, drew a train of eight loaded wagons, weighing 30 tons, at a speed of 4 m. an hour
        up a gradient of 1 in 450. But, in the words of the same article, “ This application of
        steam has not yet arrived at such perfection as to have brought it into general use.” </p>
    <p> The steam locomotive, however, and with it the railways, soon began to make rapid progress.
        On the Stockton &amp; Darlington railway, which was authorized by parliament in 1821, animal
        power was at first proposed, but on the advice of Stephenson, its engineer, steam-engines
        were adopted. This line, with three branches, was over 38 m. jn length, and was in the first
        instance laid with a single track, passing-places being provided at intervals of a quarter
        of a mile. At its opening, on the 27th of September 1825, a train of thirty-four vehicles,
        making a gross load of about 90 tons, was drawn by one engine driven by Stephenson, with a
        signalman on horseback in advance. The train moved off at the rate of from 10 to 12 m. an
        hour, and attained a speed of 15 m. an hour on favourable parts of the line. A train
        weighing 92 tons could be drawn by one engine at the rate of 5 m. an hour. The principal
        business of the new railway was the conveyance of minerals and goods, but from the first
        passengers insisted upon being carried, and on tbe 10th of October 1825 the company began to
        run a daily coach, called the “ Experiment,” to carry six inside, and from fifteen to twenty
        outside, making the journey from Darlington to Stockton and back in two hours. The fare was
        is., and each passenger was allowed to take baggage not exceeding 14 lb weight. The rate for
        carriage of merchandise was reduced from 3d. to one-fifth of a penny per ton per mile, and
        that of minerals from 7d. to i§d. per ton per mile. The price of coals .at Darlington fell
        from 18s. to 8s. 6d. a ton. </p>
    <p> The example of the Stockton &amp; Darlington line was followed by the Monklands railway in
        Scotland, opened in 1826, and several other small lines—including the Canterbury &amp; </p>
    <p> Whitstable, worked partly by fixed engines and partly by locomotives—quickly adopted steam
        traction. But the Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway, opened in 1830, first impressed the
        national mind with the fact that a revolution in the methods of travelling had really taken
        place; and further, it was for it that the first high-speed locomotive of the modem type was
        invented and constructed. The directors having offered a prize of £500 for the best engine,
        trials were held on a finished portion of the line at Rainhill in October 1829, and three
        engines took part—the Rocket of George and Robert Stephenson, the Novelty of John
        Braithwaite and John Ericsson, and the Sanspareil of Timothy Hackworth. The last two of
        these engines broke down under trial, but the Rocket fulfilled the conditions and won the
        prize. Its two steam cylinders were 8 in. in diameter, with a stroke of i6§ in., and the
        driving wheels, which were placed in front under the funnel, were 4 ft. 8$ in. in diameter.
        The engine weighed 4i tons; the tender following it, 3 tons 4cwt.; and the two loaded
        carriages drawn by it on the trial, 9 tons rr cwt.: thus the weight drawn was i2j tons, and
        the gross total of the train 17 tons. The boiler evaporated 18{ cub. ft., or 114 gals., of
        water an hour, and the steam pressure was 50 lb per square inch. The engine drew a train
        weighing 13 tons 35 m. in 48 minutes, the rate being thus nearly 44 m. an hour; subsequently
        it drew an average gross load of 40 tons behind the tender at 13*3 m. an hour. The Rocket
        possessed the three elements of efficiency of the modern locomotive—the internal
        water-surrounded fire-box and the multitubular flue in the boiler; the blast-pipe, by which
        the steam after doing its work in the cylinders was exhausted up the chimney, and thus
        served to increase the draught and promote the rapid combustion of the fuel; and the direct
        connexion of the steam cylinders, one on each side of the engine, with the two driving
        wheels mounted on one axle. Of these features, the blast-pipe had been employed by
        Trevithick on his engine of 1804, and direct driving, without intermediate gearing, had been
        adopted in several previous engines; but the use of a number (25) of small tubes in place of
        one or two large flues was an innovation which in conjunction with the blast-pipe
        contributed greatly to the efficiency of the engine. After the success of the Rocket, the
        Stephensons received orders to build seven more engines, which were of very similar design,
        though rather larger, being four-wheeled engines, with the two driving wheels in front and
        the cylinders behind; and in October 1830 they constructed a ninth engine, the Planet, also
        for the Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway, which still more closely resembled the modem
        type, since the driving wheels were placed at the fire-box end, while the two cylinders were
        arranged under the smoke-box, inside the frames. The main features of the steam locomotive
        were thus established, and its subsequent development is chiefly a history of gradual
        increase in size and power, and of improvements in design, in material and in mechanical
        construction, tending to increased efficiency and economy of operation.</p>
    <p> In America the development of the locomotive dates from almost the same time as in England.
        The earliest examples used in that country, apart from a small experimental model
        constructed by Peter Cooper, came from England. In 1828, on behalf of the Delaware &amp;
        Hudson Canal Company, which had determined to build a line, 16 m. long, from Carbondale to
        Honesdale, Pennsylvania, Horatio Allen ordered three locomotives from Messrs Foster &amp;
        Rastrick, of Stourbridge, and one from George Stephenson. The latter, named the America, was
        the first to be delivered, reaching New York in January 1829, but one of the others, the
        Stourbridge Lion, was actually the first practical steam locomotive to run in America, which
        it did on the 9th of August 1829. The first American-built loeemotive, the Best Friend, of
        Charleston, was made at the West Point Foundry, New York, in 1830, and was put to work on
        the South Carolina railroad in that year. It had a vertical boiler, and was carried on four
        wheels all coupled, the two cylinders being placed in an inclined position and having a bore
        of about 6 in. with a stroke of r6 in. It</p>
    <p> is reported to have hauled 40 or 50 passengers in 4 or 5 cars at a speed of 16-21 m. an
        hour. After a few months of life it was blown up, its attendant, annoyed by the sound of the
        escaping steam, having fastened down the safety-valve. A second engine, the West Point, also
        built at West Point Foundry for the South Carolina railroad, differed from the Best Friend
        in having a horizontal boiler with 6 or 8 tubes, though in other respects it was similar. In
        1831 the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Company offered a prize of $4000 for an American engine
        weighing 3£ tons, able to draw 15 tons at 15 m. an hour on the level: it was won by the York
        of Messrs Davis &amp; Gartner in the following year. Matthias W. Baldwin, the founder of the
        famous Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, built his first engine, Old Ironsides, for
        the Philadelphia, Germantown &amp; Morristowfi railroad; first tried in November 1832, it
        was modelled on Stephenson’s Planet, and had a single pair of driving wheels at the firebox
        end and a pair of carrying wheels under the smoke-box. His second engine, the E. L. Miller,
        delivered to the South Carolina railroad in 1834, presented a feature which has remained
        characteristic of American locomotives—the front part was supported on a four-wheeled
        swivelling bogie-truck, a device, however, which had been applied to Puffing Billy in
        England when it was rebuilt in 1815.</p>
    <p> The Liverpool &amp; Manchester line achieved a success which surpassed the anticipations
        even of its promoters, and in consequence numerous projects were started for the
        construction of railways in various parts of Great Britain. In the decade following its
        opening nearly 2000 m. of railway were sanctioned by parliament, including the beginnings of
        most of the existing trunk-lines, and in 1840 the actual mileage reached 1331 m. The next
        decade saw the “ railway mania.” The amount of capital which parliament authorized railway
        companies to raise was about 4^ millions on the average of the two years 1842-1843, 175
        millions in 1844, 60 millions in 1845, and 132 millions in 1846, though this last sum was
        less than a quarter of the capital proposed in the schemes submitted to the Board of Trade;
        and the wild speculation which occurred in railway shares in 1845 contributed largely to the
        financial crisis of 1847. In 1850 the mileage was 6635, in i860 it was 10,410, and in 1870
        it was 15,310. The increase in the decade 1860-1870 was thus nearly 50%, but subsequently
        the rate of increase slackened, and the mileages in 1880, 1890 and 1900 were 17,935, 20,073
        and 21,855. In the United States progress was more rapid, for, beginning at 2816 in 1840,
        the mileage reached 9015 in 1850, 30,600 in i860, 87,801 in 1880, and 198,964 in 1900.
        Canada had no railway till 1853, and in South America construction did not begin till about
        the same time. France and Austria opened their first lines in 1828; Belgium, Germany,
        Russia, Italy and Holland in the succeeding decade; Switzerland and Denmark in 1844, Spain
        in 1848, Sweden in 1851, Norway in 1853, and Portugal in 1854; while Turkey and Greece
        delayed till i860 and 1869. In Africa Egypt opened her first line (between Alexandria and
        Cairo) in 1856, and Cape Colony followed in i860. In Asia the first line was that between
        Bombay and Tannah, opened in 1853, and in Australia Victoria began her railway system in
        1854 (see also the articles on the various countries for further details about their
        railways).</p>
    <p> Transcontinental Railways.—A railway line across North America was first completed in 1869,
        when the Union Pacific, building from the Missouri river at Omaha (1400 m. west of New
        York), met the Central Pacific, which built from San Francisco eastwards, making a line 1848
        m. long through a country then for the most part uninhabited. This was followed by the
        Southern Pacific in 1881, from San Francisco to New r Orleans, 2489 miles; the Northern
        Pacific, from St Paul to Portland, Ore., in 1883; the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa F6, from
        Kansas City to San Diego; and the Great Northern, from St* Paul to Seattle and New
        Westminster in 1893. Meanwhile the Canadian Pacific, a true transcontinental line, was built
        from Montreal, on Atlantic tide-water, to the Pacific at Vancouver, 2906 m. But these lines
        have been</p>
    <p> dwarfed since 1891 by the Siberian railway, built by the Russian government entirely across
        the continent of Asia from Cheliabinsk (1769 m. by rail east of St Petersburg) to
        Vladivostok, a distance of 4073 m., with a branch from Kharbin about 500 m. long to Dalny
        and Port Arthur. The main line was finished in 1902, except for a length of about 170 m. in
        very difficult country around the south end of Lake Baikal; this was constructed in 1904,
        communication being maintained in the interval by ferry-boats, which conveyed all the
        carriages of a train across the lake, more than 40 m., when the ice permitted. A
        transcontinental line was long ago undertaken across South America from Buenos Aires to
        Valparaiso, where the continent is only about 900 m. wide. The last section through the
        Andes was finished in 1910. (H. M. R.) </p>
    <p> General Statistics </p>
    <p> Mileages At the close of 1907 there were approximately 601,808 miles of railway in the
        world, excluding tramways. On the whole, the best statistical source for this information is
        the annual computation published by the Archtv fur Eisenbahn-wesetiy the official organ of
        the Prussian Ministry of Public Works; but the figure quoted above utilizes the Board of
        Trade returns for the United Kingdom and the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission
        for the United States. In the United States and in certain other countries, a fiscal year,
        ending on the 30th of June or at some other irregular period, is substituted for the
        calendar year. </p>

    <p> In the United States railway mileage now tends to increase at the rate of slightly over 5000
        miles a year, which is about 2\% on the present main line mileage. In the ’ eighties, the
        country passed through a period of competitive building, which was productive of much
        financial disaster. Thus, in 1882, 11,569 m. were built—an addition equivalent to more than
        11% of mileage then existing—and in 1887, 12,876 m. were built. Unjustifiable railway
        expansion had much to do with the American commercial panics of 1884 and 1893. After the
        reconstruction period of the 1893 panic, however, the tendency for a number of years was to
        spend larger sums in bettering existing railways rather than in new extensions. The decade
        from 1896 until 1905, inclusive, saw huge sums spent on yards, passing tracks, grade
        reduction, elimination of curves, substitution of large locomotives and cars for small ones,
        &amp;c. During those ten years, the route mileage increased 34,991 m., or 17%, while the
        mileage of second, third, fourth and yard tracks and sidings increased 32,666 m., or nearly
        57%. The number of locomotives increased 12,407, or 35%, and the number of freight cars,
        545,222, or 42%. Moreover, the average tractive power per locomotive and the average
        capacity per freight car advanced greatly in this period, although specific figures cannot
        be given. ^ Thus it may fairly be said that the railway system of the United States was
        reconstructed between 1896 and 1905, so far as concerns rails, sleepers, ballast and the
        general capacity of a given group of lines to perform work. About 1905, however, a new
        tendency became apparent. At that time the so-called transcontinental railways, connecting
        the Pacific coast of the United States with the central portions of the country, and thus
        with the group of railways reaching the Atlantic seaboard, consisted of five railways within
        the borders of the United States, and one in Canada, in Canada the Canadian Pacific was the
        only transcontinental line, extending from St John, on the bay of Fundy, and from Quebec, on
        the river St Lawrence, to Vancouver, on the strait of Georgia, the distance from St John to
        Vancouver being approximately 3379 m. Within the boundaries of the United States the
        northernmost of the transcontinental lines was the Great Northern railway, extending from a
        point opposite Vancouver, B.C., and from Seattle, Wash., to Duluth, on Lake Superior, and to
        St Paul and Minneapolis, Minn., where connexion through to Chicago was made over an allied
        line, the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy, owned jointly by the Great Northern and the
        Northern Pacific. </p>
    <p> Next, south of the Great Northern, lay the Northern Pacific railway, starting on the west
        from Portland, Ore., and from Seattle and Tacoma, Wash., and extending east to Duluth, St
        Paul and Minneapolis by way of Helena, Mont. The Central Pacific-Union Pacific route to the
        coast, with its important affiliated companies, the Oregon Short Line and the Oregon
        Railroad &amp; Navigation Company, extended from San Francisco, Cal., and Portland, Ore., to
        Omaha, Neb., by way of Salt Lake City; the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa F6 extended from San
        Francisco and Los Angeles, Cal., to Chicago and to Galveston, Tex.; while the Southern
        Pacific had its line from San Francisco and Los Angeles to Galveston and New Orleans,
        running for the greater part of the distance just north of the Mexican border. </p>
    <p> * Thus it will be observed that the five great cities of the Pacific coast—Seattle and
        Tacoma, Wash., Portland, Ore., and San Francisco and Los Angeles, Cal.—were already well
        supplied with railways; but the growth of the fertile region lying west of the
        transcontinental divide was most attractive to American railway builders; and railways
        serving this district, almost all of them in trouble ten years before, were showing great
        increases in earnings. In 1903 the Gould lines determined to enter this Pacific territory.
        Hitherto the western terminus of this group of lines had been Salt Lake City, Utah; by the
        exceedingly bold construction of the Western Pacific from Salt Lake City to Oakland, Cal.,
        opposite San Francisco, an additional line to the Pacific coast was provided, having low
        grades and being in all respects well adapted for cheap operation. </p>
    <p> Shortly after the plans were announced for building the Western Pacific, the Chicago,
        Milwaukee &amp; St Paul also decided to extend west. Before that time the St Paul had been a
        great local railway, operating primarily in the Dakotas, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and
        Illinois; but by the construction of a long arm from the Missouri river to Spokane, Seattle
        and Tacoma, it became a transcontinental line of the first importance, avoiding the mistakes
        of earlier railway builders by securing a line with easy gradients through the most
        favourable regions. </p>
    <p> At the same time that these two extensions were being undertaken by old and well-established
        railways, a new company—the Kansas City, Mexico &amp; Orient—was engaged in constructing a
        line almost due south-west fro in Kansas City, Mo., to the lower part of the gulf of
        California in Mexico; while an additional independent line was under construction from
        Denver in a north-westerly direction towards the Pacific coast. The guarantee for this
        activity may be illustrated by a single fact: the combined building operations, in 1908, of
        San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, Spokane and Salt Lake City exceeded the
        combined building operations of Philadelphia, Pittsburg, Kansas City, Boston, Baltimore and
        Cincinnati during the same year. San Francisco spent more in new permanent structures than
        Philadelphia, and Seattle spent more than Pittsburg. </p>
    <p> Recent American railway development, viewed in its larger aspects, has thus been
        characterized by what may be described as the rediscovery of the Pacific coast ; How far
        this movement will extend it is impossible to say; it is certain, however, that it will be
        enormously important in re-aligning trade conditions in the United States, Canada and
        Mexico. </p>

    <p> having nearly the same amount of railway mileage. In Mexico the national government is
        carrying out a consistent policy of developing its railway lines. It has succeeded in
        restoring the credit of these enterprises, and is proceeding with care and skill to form the
        lines into an efficient transportation system. In Argentina about 15% of the railways are
        owned and operated by the government, the balance being in the hands of private companies,
        largely^ controlled in England. Development 01 these lines has been primarily an extension
        from the large cities in the East to the agricultural districts in the West, but a change of
        great importance was brought about in 1910 by the completion of the last tunnel on the
        Argentine Transandine Railway, which serves to connect Santiago, Valparaiso and the other
        great cities of the west coast with Buenos Aires, Montevideo, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and the
        other great cities of the cast coast. Naturally the company named docs not reach all of
        these points, but its line across the Andes supplies the indispensable link of
        communication, in the absence of which the east coast towns and the west coast towns have
        hitherto been as widely separated as if they had been located on different
        continents—indeed, far more widely separated in point of time and of freight charges than
        Great Britain and the United States.</p>

    <p> Although more than half of the total mileage of Asia is in British India, it is probable
        that the greatest proportionate gains in the near future will be in China, Siberia and
        Manchuria, and Central Russia in Asia. In proportion to its population China has the least
        railway development of any of the great countries of the world; the probability that its
        present commercial awakening will extend seems large, and in that case it will need a vast
        increase in its interior communications.</p>
    <p> In Africa, it wiU be seen by Table V. that the railway mileage in the British possessions
        amounts to almost five-sixths of the total.</p>

    <p> The so-called Cape-to-Cairo route shows occasional extensions, particularly in the opening
        up of new country in Central Africa by the Rhodesian railway system. The Rhodesian railway
        system in 1910 had penetrated north of Broken Hill, which is just above the fifteenth
        parallel of south latitude, while the Egyptian railway system had reached Gondokoro, located
        close to the fifth parallel of north latitude. The intervening distance, through country
        exceedingly unhealthy for white men, and therefore promising no traffic except raw
        materials, does not seem a likely field for rapid railway extension.</p>
    <p> In Australia the increase in railway mileage in the five years ending December 31st, 1907
        was about 7%—a small proportion as compared with America, Asia or Africa. The greatest
        increase, both relative and absolute, was in Queensland; the smallest in South Australia,
        which added only 24 m. during the five years. Yet the mileage open per 10,000 inhabitants in
        Australia, as a whole, far surpasses that in any other of the broad geographical
        divisions.</p>

    <p> Table VII. illustrates the mileage open to the end of 1007 per 100 sq. m. of territory and
        per 10,000 inhabitants. It will be observed that Belgium leads all the countries of the
        world in what may be called its railway density, with the United Kingdom a far-distant
        second in the list, and Persia last. In railway mileage per 10,000 inhabitants, however,
        Queensland, in the Australian group, reports a figure mufch greater than any other country;
        while at the other end of the list Persia holds the record for isolation.</p>

    <p> Capital .—The total construction capital invested in the railways of the world in 1907 was
        estimated by the Archiv für Eisenbahnwesen at £8,986,150,000; the figure is necessarily
        incomplete, though it serves as a rough approximation. This total was divided nearly evenly
        between the countries of Europe and the rest of the world. The United States of America,
        with a capital of £3,059,800,000 invested in its railways on the 30th of June 1906, was
        easily ahead of every other country, and in 1908 the figure was increased to £3,443,027,685,
        of which £2,636,569,089 was in the hands of the public. On a route-mileage basis, however,
        the capital cost of the British railway system is far greater than that of any other country
        in the world, partly because a vast proportion of the lines are double, treble or even
        quadruple, partly because the safety^ requirements of the Board of Trade and the high
        standards of the original builders made actual construction very costly. </p>
    <p> The total paid-up railway capital of the United Kingdom amounted, in 1908, to
        £1,310,533,212, or an average capitalization of £56,476 per route mile, though it should be
        noted that this total included £196,364,618 of nominal additions through ^ “
        stock-splitting,” &amp;c. Per mile of single track, the capitalization in England and Wales,
        Scotland, Ireland and the United Kingdom, is shown in Table VIII. </p>

    <p> The table excludes sidings, because they cannot fairly be compared with running tracks, mile
        for mile. Yet the mileage of sidings in the United Kingdom amounted to 14,353 in 1908, and
        the cost of constructing them was probably not far from £6o,ooo,ood. </p>
    <p> On a single-track-mile basis, the following comparison may be made between apparent capital
        costs in Great Britain and the United States:— </p>
    <p> Single-Track Paid-up Capital Mileage. per Mile. </p>
    <p> United Kingdom, 1908 . . 39 * 3 16 ¿ 33.333 </p>
    <p> United States, 1908 . . . 254,192 10,372* </p>
    <p> The figures for the United States are from the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission
        for the year ended 30th of June 1908, and comprise mileage of first, second, third and
        fourth tracks, and paid-up capital in the hands of the public only. The British figures are
        from the Board of Trade returns for the calendar year 1908. In comparing the figures, it
        should be noted that main line mileage in the Eastern states, as for example that of the
        Pennsylvania railroad and the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford, does not differ greatly in
        standards of safety or in unit cost from the best British construction, although improvement
        work in America is charged to income far more liberally than it has been in England. But
        there are long stretches of pine loam in the South where branch lines can be, and are, built
        and equipped for £2400 or less per mile, while the construction of new main line in the
        prairie region of the West ought not to cost more than £4000 per single-track-mile, under
        present conditions. </p>
    <p> The problem of the early railway builders in the United States was to conquer the
        wilderness, to build an empire, and at the same time to bind the East to the West and the
        North to the South. There can be little doubt but that the United States would long ago have
        disintegrated into separate, warring republics, had they not been bound together by
        railways, and standards of safety were </p>
    <p> rightly subordinated to the main task to be accomplished. Conquest is not usually bloodless,
        whether achieved at the van of a marching column or at the head of a hastily-built railway,
        and the process under which the American railway system took form left the way open for a
        distressing record of accidents to the traveller and the railway servant. But as traffic
        becomes more dense, year by year, the rebuilding process is constant, and American railway
        lines are gradually becoming safer </p>
    <p> In Europe the average route-mile capital is £27,036, and Table IX. shows the differences
        between various countries. </p>

        has two distinct aspects. It has been well said that statistics furnish the means by which
        the railway manager disciplines his property; this is the aspect of control. On the other
        hand, the banker, the government official and the economist use railway statistics to obtain
        information which may be characterized as static rather than dynamic. Both uses ultimately
        rest upon comparison of the observed data from a certain property with the observed data
        from other properties, or with predetermined standards of performance. </p>
    <p> In general, the British working unit supplied as public information has always been the
        goods-train-mile and the passenger-train-mile, these figures being the products of the
        number of trains into the number of miles they have travelled. In America, the basic units
        have been the ton-mile and the passenger-mile, and these figures are now required to be
        furnished to the Interstate Commerce Commission and to most of the state commissions as
        well. Both the British manager and the American manager, however, are supplied with a
        considerable number of daily, weekly and monthly reports, varying on different railways,
        which are not made public. The daily sheets usually include a summarized statement of the
        performance of every train on the line, covering the amount of business done, the
        destination of the loads, &amp;c. For a number of years there has been a movement in Great
        Britain to require the inclusion of ton-mile statistics in the stated returns to the Board
        of Trade, but most railway managers have objected to the change on the ground that their own
        confidential information was already adequate for purposes of control, afid that ton-mile
        statistics would require additional clerical force to a costly extent. The Departmental
        Committee of the Board of Trade, sitting in 1909 to consider railway accounting forms, while
        recommending ton-miles to the careful consideration of those responsible for railway working
        in Great Britain, considered the question of their necessity in British practice to be still
        open, and held that, at all events, they should not be introduced under compulsion. </p>

    <p> Economics and Legislation </p>
    <p> It was at one time an axiom of law and of political economy that prices should be determined
        by free competition. But in the development of the railway business it soon became evident
        that no such dependence on free competition was possible, either in practice or in theory.
        This difficulty is not peculiar to railways; but it was in the history of railway economy
        and railway control that certain characteristics which are now manifesting themselves in all
        directions where large investments of fixed capital are involved were first brought
        prominently to public notice.</p>
    <p> For a large number of those who use a railway, competition in its more obvious forms does
        not and cannot exist. Independent carriers cannot run trains over the same line and underbid
        one another in offering transportation services. It would be practically impossible for a
        line thus used by different carriers to be operated either with safety, or with economy, or
        with the advantage to the public which a centralized management affords. It is equally
        impossible for the majority of shippers to enjoy the competition of parallel lines. Such
        duplication of railways involves a waste of capital. If parallel lines compete at all
        points, they cause ruin to the investors. If they compete at some points and not at others,
        they produce a discrimination or preference with regard to rates and facilities, which
        builds up the competitive points at the expense of the non-competitive ones. Such partial
        competition, with the discrimination it,involves, is liable to be worse for the public than
        no competition at all. It increases the tendency, already too strong, towards concentration
        of industrial life in large towns. It produces an uncertainty with regard to rates which
        prevents stability of prices, and is apt to promote the interests of the unscrupulous
        speculator at the expense of those whose business methods are more conservative. So marked
        are these evils that such partial competition is avoided by agreements between the competing
        lines with regard to rates, and by divisions of traffic, or pools, which shall take away the
        temptation to violate such rate agreements. The common law has been somewhat unfavourable to
        the enforcement of such agreements, and statutes in the United States,both local and
        national, have attempted to prohibit them; but the public advantage from their existence has
        been so great as to render their legal disabilities inoperative. In those parts of the
        continent of Europe where railways are owned and administered by state authority, the
        necessity for such agreements is frankly admitted.</p>
    <p> But if rates are to be fixed by agreement, and not by competition, what principle can be
        recognized as a legitimate basis of railway rate-making? The first efforts at railway
        legislation were governed by the equal mileage principle; that is, the attempt was made to
        make rates proportionate to the distance. It was, however, soon seen that this was
        inadmissible. So much of the expense of the handling, both of freight and of passengers, was
        independent of the length of the journey that a mileage rate sufficiently large for short
        distances was unnecessarily burdensome for long ones, and was bound to destroy long-distance
        traffic, if the theory were consistently applied. The system has been retained in large
        measure in passenger business, but only because of the conflict which inevitably occurs
        between the authorities and the passengers with regard to the privilege of breaking and
        resuming a journey when passenger rates are arranged on any other plan. In freight schedules
        it has been completely abandoned.</p>
    <p> A somewhat better theory of rate regulation was then framed, which divided railway
        expenditures into movement expense, connected with the line in general, and terminal
        expense, which connected itself with the stations and station service. Under this system
        each consignment of freight is compelled to pay its share of the terminal expense,
        independently of distance, plus a mileage charge proportionate to the length of the journey
        or haul. There has been also a further attempt in England to divide terminal charges into
        station and service terminals, according to the nature of the work for which compensation is
        sought. But none of these classifications of expense reaches the root of the matter. A
        system of charges which compels each piece of traffic to pay its share of the charges for
        track and for stations overlooks the fundamental fact that a very large part of the expenses
        of a railway—more than half—is not</p>
    <p> connected either with the cost of moving traffic or of handling traffic at stations, but
        with the cost of maintaining the property as a whole. Of this character are the expenditures
        necessary for maintenance of way, for general administration and for interest on capital
        borrowed, which are almost independent of the total amount of business done, and quite
        independent of any individual piece of business. To say that all traffic must bear its share
        of these interest and maintenance charges is to impose upon the railways a rate which would
        cut off much of the longdistance traffic, and much of the traffic in cheap articles, which
        is of great value to the public, and which, from its very magnitude, is a thing that
        railways could not afford to lose. It is also a fact that with each recurring decade these
        general expenses (also called indirect, undistributed or fixed charges) have an increased
        importance as compared with the particular (direct, distributed or operating) expense
        attaching naturally to the particular portions of the traffic. For with increased density of
        population it becomes profitable to make improvements on the original location, even though
        this may involve increased charges for interest and for some parts of its maintenance, for
        the sake of securing that economy of operation, through larger train-loads, which such an
        improved location makes possible.</p>
    <p> Whatever the ostensible form of a railway tariff, the contribution of the different
        shipments of freight to these general expenses is determined on the principle of charging
        what the traffic will bear. Under this principle, rates arc reduced where the increase of
        business which follows such reduction makes the change a profitable one. They are kept
        relatively high in those cases where the expansion of business which follows a reduction is
        small, and where such a change is therefore unprofitable. This theory of charging what the
        traffic will bear is an unpopular one, because it has been misapplied by railway managers
        and made an excuse for charging what the traffic will not bear. Rightly applied, however, it
        is the only sound economic principle. It means taxation according to ability—that ability
        being determined by actual experiment.</p>
    <p> In the practical carrying out of this principle, railways divide all articles of freight
        into classes, the highest of which are charged two or three, or even four times the rates of
        the lowest. This classification is based partly upon special conditions of service, which
        make some articles more economical to carry than others (with particular reference to the
        question whether the goods are offered to the companies in car-loads or in smkll parcels),
        but chiefly with regard to the commercial value of the article, and its consequent ability
        to bear a high charge or a low one. For each of these classes a rate-sheet gives the actual
        rate-charge per unit of weight between the various stations covered by the tariff. This rate
        increases as the distance increases, hut not in equal proportion; while the rates from large
        trade centres to other trade centres at a great distance are not higher than those to
        intermediate points somewhat less remote; if the law permits, there is a tendency to make
        them actually a little lower. Besides the system of charges thus prescribed in the
        classification and rate-sheet, each tariff provides for a certain number of special rates or
        charges made for particular lines of trade in certain localities, independently of their
        relation to the general system. If these special rates are published in the tariff, and are
        offered to all persons alike, provided they can fulfil the conditions imposed by the
        company, they are known as commodity rates, and arc apparently a necessity in any scheme of
        railway charges. If, however, they are not published, and are given to certain persons as
        individual favours, they become a prolific source of abuse, and are quite indefensible from
        the standpoint of political economy.</p>
    <p> While the superficial appearance of the railway tariff is different for different countries,
        and somefimes for different parts of the same country, the general principles laid down are
        followed in rate-making by all well-managed fines, whether state or private. It is a mistake
        to suppose that the question of public or private ownership will make any considerable
        difference in the system of rate-making adopted by a good railway. A state system will be
        compelled, by the exigencies</p>
    <p> of the public treasury, to arrange its rates to pay interest on its securities; a private
        company will generally be prevented, by the indirect competition of railways in other parts
        of the country which it serves, from doing very much more than this. The relative merit of
        the two systems depends upon the question how we can secure the best efficiency and equity
        in the application of the principles thus far laid down. There are three different systems
        of control:— </p>
    <p> 1. Private operation , subject only to judicial regulation , was exemplified most fully in
        the early railway history of the United States. Until 1870 railway companies were almost
        free from special acts of control; and, in general, any company that could raise or borrow
        the capital was allowed to build a railway wherever it saw fit. In the United Kingdom there
        was almost as much immunity from legislative interference with charges, but the companies
        were compelled to secure special charters, and to conform to regulations made by the Board
        of Trade in the interests of public safety. The advantage of this relatively free system of
        railway building and management is that it secures efficient and progressive methods. Most
        of the improvements in operation and in traffic management have had their origin in one of
        these two countries. The disadvantage attendant upon this system is that the courts are
        reluctant to exercise the right of regulation, except on old and traditional lines, and that
        in the face of new business methods the public may be inadequately protected. There is also
        this further disadvantage, that in the gradual progress ôf consolidation railway companies
        take upon themselves the aspect of large monopolies, of whose apparently unrestricted power
        the public is jealous. As a result of these difficulties there has been, both in the United
        Kingdom and in the United States, a progressive increase of legislative interference with
        railways. In the former the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1854 specially prohibited
        preferences, either in facilities or in rates. The Regulation of Railways Act of 1873
        provided for a Railway Commission, which should be so constituted as to take cognizance of
        cases on the investigation of which the courts were reluctant to enter. Finally, the
        legislation of 1888 put into the hands of a reorganized Railway Commission and of the Board
        of Trade powers none the less important in principle because their action has been less in
        its practical effect than the advocates of active control demanded. In the United States the
        years from 1870 to 1875 witnessed sweeping and generally ill-considered legislation (“
        Granger n Acts) concerning railway charges throughout the Mississippi valley; while the
        years from 1884 to 1887 were marked by more conservative, and for that reason more
        enforceable, acts, which culminated in the Interstate Commerce Act, prohibiting personal
        discrimination and gradually restricting discrimination between places, and providing for a
        National Commission of very considerable power—not to speak of the pooling clause, which was
        extraneous to the general purpose of the act, and has tended to defeat rather than
        strengthen its operation. </p>
    <p> 2. Operation by private companies , under specific provisions of the government authorities
        with regard to the method of its exercise , has been the policy consistently carried out in
        France, and less systematically and consistently in other countries under the domination of
        the Latin race. It was believed by its advocates that this system of prescribing the
        conditions of construction and operation of lines could promote public safety, prevent waste
        of capital and secure passengers and shippers against extortionate rates. These expectations
        have been only partially fulfilled. Well trained as was the civil service of France, the
        effect of this supervision in deadening activity was sometimes more marked than in its
        effect in preventing abuse. Moreover, such a system of regulation almost necessarily carries
        with it a guarantee of monopoly to the various companies concerned, and not infrequently
        large gifts in the form of subsidies, for without such aid private capital will not submit
        to the special burdens involved. These rights, whether of monopoly or of subsidy, form a
        means of abuse in many directions. Where the government is bad, they are a fruitful source
        of corruption; even where it is good, they enable the companies to drive hard bargains with
        the public, and prevent the expected benefits of official control from being realized. </p>
    <p> 3. State operation and ownership is a system which originated in Belgium at the beginning of
        railway enterprise, and has been consistently carried out by the Scandinavian countries and
        by Hungary. Since i860 it has been the policy of Australia. It has generally come to be that
        of Germany and, so far as the finances of the countries allow, of Austria and Russia;
        British India also affords not a few examples of the same method. The theory of state
        ownership is excellent. So large a part of the railway charge is of the nature of a tax,
        that there seem to be a priori reasons for leaving the taxing powers in the hands of the
        agents of the government. In practice its operation is far more uncertain. Whether the
        intelligence and efficiency of the officials charged by the state with the handling of its
        railway system will be sufficient to make them act in the interest of the public as fully as
        do the managers of private corporations, is a question whose answer can only be determined
        by actual experience in each case... If they fail to have these qualities, the complete
        monopoly which a government enjoys, and the powers of borrowing which are furnished by the
        use of the public credit, increase instead of diminishing the danger of arbitrary action,
        unprogressiveness and waste of capital. Even in matters like public safety it is by no means
        certain that government authorities will do so well as private ones. The question is one
        which practical railway men have long since ceased to argue on general principles; they
        recognize that the answer depends upon the respective degree of talent and integrity which
        characterize the business community on the one hand and the government officials on the
        other. </p>

        Nationalization (1908), and E. A. Davis’s Nationalization of Railways (1908). (A. T. H.) </p>
    <p> British Railway Legislation </p>
    <p> The first thing a railway company in Great Britain has to do is to obtain a special or
        private act of parliament authorizing the construction of the line. Not that the mere laying
        or working of a railway requires parliamentary sanction, tion!*™ 0 ' so long as the work
        does not interfere with other people's rights and interests. An example of a railway built
        without any legislative authority is the little mountain railway from Llanberis to the
        summit of Snowdon, which was made by the owner of the land through which it passes. Such a
        railway has no statutory rights and no special obligations, and the owner of it is liable to
        be sued for creating a nuisance if the working of the line interferes with the comfort of
        those residing in the neighbourhood. When, however, a company desires to construct a line on
        a commercial scale, to acquire land compulsorily, to divert rivers and streams, to cross
        roads either on the level or by means of bridges, to pass near houses, to build tunnels or
        viaducts, and to execute all the other works incidental to a railway, and to work the line
        when completed without interference, it is essential that the authority of parliament should
        be obtained. The company therefore promotes a bill, which is considered first by select
        committees of the two houses of parliament, and afterwards by the two houses themselves,
        during which period it faces the opposition, if any, of rival concerns, of local authorities
        and of hostile landowners. If this is successfully overcome, and the proposals meet with the </p>
    <p> approval of parliament, the bill is passed and, after securing the Royal Assent, becomes an
        act of parliament. The company is then free to proceed with the work of construction, and at
        once becomes subject to various general acts, such as the Companies Clauses Act, which
        affects all joint-stock companies incorporated by any special act; the Land Clauses Act,
        which has reference to all companies having powers to acquire land compulsorily; the Railway
        Clauses Act, which imposes certain conditions on all railways alike (except light railways);
        the various Regulation of Railways Acts; the Carriers Protection Act; acts for the
        conveyance of mails, parcels, troops; acts relating to telegraphs, to the conveyance of
        workmen and to the housing of the labouring classes; and several others which it is
        unnecessary to specify. From the early days of railways parliament has also been careful to
        provide for the safety of the public by inserting in the general or special acts definite
        conditions, and by laying upon the Board of Trade the duty of protecting the public using a
        railway.</p>
    <p> The first act which has reference to the safety of passengers is the Regulation of Railways
        Act of 1842, which obliges every railway company to give notice to the Board of Trade of its
        intention to open the railway for passenger traffic, and places upon that public department
        the duty of inspecting the line before the opening of it takes place. If the officer
        appointed by the Board of Trade should, after inspection of the railway, report to the
        department that in his opinion “ the opening of the same would be attended with danger to
        the public using the same, by reason of the incompleteness of the works or permanent way, or
        the insufficiency of the establishment for working such railway,” it is lawful for the
        department to direct the company to postpone the opening of the line for any period not
        exceeding one month at a time, the process being repeated from month to month as often as
        may be necessary. The company is liable to a fine of twenty pounds a day if it should open
        the line in contravention of such order or direction. The inspections made by the officers
        of the Board of Trade under this act are very complete: the permanent way, bridges,
        viaducts, tunnels and other works are carefully examined; all iron or steel girders are
        tested; stations, including platforms, stairways, waiting-rooms, &amp;c., are inspected; and
        the signalling and “ interlocking ” are thoroughly overhauled. A code of requirements in
        regard to the opening of new railways has been drawn up by the department for the guidance
        of railway companies, and as the special circumstances of each line are considered on their
        merits, it rarely happens that the department finds it necessary to prohibit the opening of
        a new railway. The Regulation of Railways Act of 1871 extends the provisions of the above
        act to the opening of “ any additional line of railway, deviation line, station, junction or
        crossing on the level ” which forms a portion of or is connected with a passenger railway,
        and which has been constructed subsequently to the inspection of it. This act further
        defines the duties and powers of the inspectors of the Board of Trade, and also authorizes
        the Board to dispense with the notice which the previous act requires to be given prior to
        the opening of a railway.</p>
    <p> It may be remarked that neither of these acts confers on the Board of Trade any power to
        inspect a railway after it has once been opened, unless and until some addition or
        alteration, such as is defined in the last-named act, has been made. When a line has once
        been inspected and passed, it lies with the company to maintain it in accordance with the
        standard of efficiency it originally possessed, but no express statutory obligation to do so
        is imposed upon the company, and whether it does so or not, the Board of Trade cannot
        interfere.</p>
    <p> The act of 1871 further renders it obligatory upon every railway company to send notice to
        the Board of Trade in the case of (1) any accident attended with loss of life or personal
        injury to any person whatsoever; (2) any collision where one of the trains is a passenger
        train;</p>
    <p> (3) any passenger train or part of such train leaving the rails;</p>
    <p> (4) any other accident likely to have caused loss of life or personal injury, and specified
        on that ground by any order</p>
    <p> made from time to time by the Board of Trade. The department is authorized, on receipt of
        such report, to direct an inquiry to be made into the cause of any accident so reported, and
        the inspector appointed to make the inquiry is given power to enter any railway premises for
        the purposes of his inquiry, and to summon any person engaged upon the railway to attend the
        inquiry as a witness, and to require the production of all books, papers and documents which
        he considers important for the purpose. The inspector, after making his investigation, is
        required to make a report to the Board of Trade as to the causes of the accident and the
        circumstances attending the same, with any observations on the subject which he deems right,
        and the Board “ shall cause every such report to be made public in such manner as they think
        expedient.” The usual mode of publishing such reports is to forward them to railway
        companies concerned, as well as to the press, and on application to any one else who is
        interested. The reports are subsequently included in a Blue-book and presented to
        parliament. It should be noted that although the inspecting officer may in his report make
        any recommendations that he may think fit with a view to guarding against any similar
        accident occurring in the future, no power is given to the Board of Trade, or to any other
        authority, to compel any railway company to adopt such recommendations. This omission is
        sometimes held to be an error, but as a fact it is an advantage. The moral effect of the
        report, with the criticisms of the company’s methods and recommendations appended thereto,
        is great, and it rarely happens that a company refuses to adopt, or at any rate to test, the
        recommendations so made. If, on the other hand, the company is of opinion that the
        suggestions of the inspecting officer are not likely to prove beneficial, or are for any
        reason unadvisable, it is at liberty to reject them, the responsibility of doing so resting
        entirely upon itself. The effect of this latitude is to give the company ample discretion in
        the matter, and to enable the act to be administered and the object of it to be attained
        without undue interference.</p>
    <p> In 1889 a very important act was passed placing upon the Board of Trade the obligation to
        call upon railway companies throughout the United Kingdom (1) to adopt upon all passenger
        lines the “ block ” system of working;</p>
    <p> (2) to “ interlock ” their points and signals; (3) to fit all trains carrying passengers
        with some form of automatic continuous brake. Prior to this some companies had, to a certain
        extent, done these things, but few, if any, were completely equipped in these respects. A
        reasonable period was afforded them, according to circumstances, to comply with these
        requirements, and at the present time the work is practically complete. In this respect the
        lines of the United Kingdom are far ahead of those of any other country, and a diminution of
        accidents, particularly of collisions, has resulted therefrom. America is now following the
        lead thus set, and all the most important lines in the United States have adopted block
        working and interlocking, but a great deal still remains to be done. In certain respects, on
        the other hand, America has gone further than the United Kingdom, especially in the matter
        of automatic signalling, and in the operating of points and signals by electrical power or
        air-pressure instead of manual labour. In America, also, freight trains are fitted with an
        automatic continuous brake, whereas in the United Kingdom this appliance is required by law
        only in the case of passenger trains, and in fact is not fitted to goods and mineral trains
        except in a few isolated instances.</p>
    <p> The above-named acts enable the Board of Trade to take all the necessary steps to ensure
        that the safety of passenger trains is sufficiently guarded. More recently legislation has
        been passed to safeguard the lives and interests of railway servants. In 1893 an act was
        passed by parliament giving the Board power to interfere if or when representations are made
        to them by or on behalf of any servant or class of servants of a railway company that the
        hours of work are unduly long, or do not provide sufficient intervals of uninterrupted rest
        between the periods of duty, or sufficient relief in respect of Sunday duty. In such cases
        the company concerned may, after inquiry, be called upon to submit such a</p>
    <p> schedule of the hours during which the man or men are employed as will bring those hours
        within limits which appear to the department reasonable. In the event of the company failing
        to comply with the demands of the department, the latter is empowered to refer the case to
        the Railway and Canal Commissioners, who form a special Court constituted by the Railway and
        Canal Traffic Act of 1888, for deciding, among other things, questions relating to rates and
        charges, for protecting traders from undue charges and undue preference, for regulating
        questions of traffic, and for deciding certain disputes between railway companies and the
        public. The Commissioners are then empowered to deal with the matter, and if “ a railway
        company fail to comply with any order made by the Railway and Canal Commissioners, or to
        enforce the provisions of any schedule ” approved by them, it is liable to a fine of a
        hundred pounds for every day during which the default continues. This act has been the means
        of effecting a considerable reduction in the hours worked by railway men on certain
        railways, and no case has yet arisen in which a reference to the Commissioners has been
        necessary. Such modifications of the hours of work have not only been beneficial to the men,
        but have improved the discipline of the staff and the punctuality and regularity of the
        train service, particularly in respect of the goods trains. </p>
    <p> The Notice of Accidents Act of 1884, which obliges employers of labour to report to the
        Board of Trade, when “there occurs in any employment ” as defined by the schedule of the
        act, “any accident which causes to any person employed therein, either loss of life or such
        bodily injury as to prevent him on any one of the three working days next after the
        occurrence of the accident from being employed for five hours on his ordinary work,” affects
        railways in course of construction, but not, as a rule, otherwise. </p>
    <p> Although the administration of the above-mentioned acts of parliament has had a beneficial
        effect upon the safety of the public, and has enabled an enormous volume of traffic to be
        handled with celerity, punctuality and absence of risk, it has during recent years come to
        notice that the number of casualties among railway servants is still unduly great, and in
        1899 a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate the causes of the numerous accidents,
        fatal and nonfat al, to railway men. As a consequence of the report of this Commission the
        Railway Employment (Prevention of Accidents) Act of 1900 was passed, putting upon the Board
        of Trade the duty of making “ such rules as they think fit with respect to any of the
        subjects mentioned in the schedule to this act, with the object of reducing or removing the
        dangers and risks incidental to railway service.” Rules may also be made in respect to other
        matters besides those mentioned in the schedule, and companies may be called upon to adopt
        or reject, as the case may be, any appliance, the use or disuse of which may be considered
        desirable in the interest of the men. Before, however, the rules so made become binding upon
        the companies, the latter have the right of appealing against them to the Railway
        Commissioners. Failure to comply with any of the rules renders a company “ liable for each
        offence, on conviction under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts, to a fine not exceeding fifty
        pounds, or in the case of a continuing offence to a fine not exceeding ten pounds for every
        day during which the offence continues after conviction.” Rules drafted by the Board of
        Trade under this act came into force on the 8th of August 1902, the subjects referred to
        being (1) labelling of wagons; (2) movements of wagons by propping and tow-roping; (3)
        power-brakes on engines; (4) lighting of stations and sidings; (5) protection of points,
        rods, &amp;c.; (6) construction and protection of gauge-glasses; (7) arrangement of
        tool-boxes, &amp;c., on engines; (8) provision of brake-vans for trains upon running lines
        beyond the limits of stations; (9) protection to permanent-way men when relaying or
        repairing permanent way. The final settlement, of a rule requiring brake-levers to be fitted
        on both sides of goods-wagons was, however, deferred, owing to objections raised by certain
        of the railway companies. </p>
    <p> Other acts which are of importance in connexion with accidents are the Accidents
        Compensation Act of 1846, the Employers 1 Liability Act of 1880, and the Workmen’s
        Compensation Act of 1897. </p>
    <p> The public acts of parliament referring to British railways are collected in Bigg’s General
        Railway A els. (H. A. Y.) </p>
    <p> American Railway Legislation </p>
    <p> Before 1870 . —The earliest legislation is contained in charters granted by special act, for
        the construction of railways. These special acts gradually gave way to general statutes
        under which railway corporations could be created without application to the legislature. In
        the east, where, as a rule, charters had been uniform and consistent, the change to general
        incorporation law was due to a desire to render incorporations speedier and less expensive.
        In the west, general laws came rather as a result of the abuses of special legislation. By
        1850, general incorporation laws were found in nearly all the eastern states, and by 1870 in
        those of the west. </p>
    <p> Early legislation was confined almost entirely to matters of construction. In cases where
        statutes did touch the question of regulation, they had to do with the operation of trains
        and with the provision of facilities for shippers and passengers, rather than with questions
        of rates. It was natural that this should be so, for the new transportation agency was so
        much more efficient than anything previously available that the people were eager to take
        advantage of its superior service. As a rule, the making of rates was left to the
        corporations. If the maximum rates were prescribed, as they sometimes were, the limit was
        placed so high as to be of no practical value for control. Such crude attempts as were made
        to prevent rates from being excessive concerned themselves with profits, and were designed
        to confiscate for the state treasury any earnings beyond a certain prescribed dividend.
        Publicity of rates was not generally required, and provisions against discrimination were
        rare. In the period before 1850 th£re was but little realization of the public nature of the
        railway industry and of the possibilities of injury to the public if railway corporations
        were left uncontrolled. </p>
    <p> In regions where capital was lacking eagerness for railway facilities led the people to
        demand the direct co-operation of the state, and many projects, most of which ended in
        disaster, were undertaken either by the state itself or through the aid of the state’s
        credit. For example, Michigan, in 1837, in the first session of its state legislature, made
        plans for the construction of 557 miles of railway under the direct control of the state,
        and the governor was authorized to issue bonds for the purpose. The unfortunate results of
        this policy led many of the states, from about 1850, to put constitutional limitations upon
        the power of their legislatures to lend the state’s credit or to involve the state as
        stockholder in the affairs of any corporation. </p>
    <p> As railway building increased in response to traffic needs, and as the consolidation of
        short lines into continuous systems proceeded, legislation applicable to railways became
        somewhat broader in scope and more intelligent. About 1850 there began to appear on the
        statute books laws requiring publicity of rates and the submission of annual reports to the
        legislature, prescribing limits to corporate indebtedness, and also making provision for
        safety in operation and for the character and quality of railway service. Consolidation and
        leasing were commonly permitted in the case of continuous lines, but were regularly
        prohibited in the case of parallel and competing lines. The practice of pooling seems not to
        have attracted the attention of the legislature. In general it may be asserted that
        legislation of this period was ill-considered, haphazard, and on a petty scale. Moreover, it
        was of little practical importance even within its narrow range, for it does not appear to
        have been generally enforced. </p>
    <p> 1870 - iQOO . —Railway legislation first assumed importance in connection with the “ Granger
        Movement ” in the middle west. There the policy of subsidies for railway building had been
        carried to a reckless extreme. Roads had been constructed in advance of settlement, and
        land-seekers had been </p>
    <p> transported to these frontier sections only to become dependent upon the railways for their
        very existence. To the unusual temptations thus offered for favouritism and discriminations
        in rates, t he railways generally yielded. This preferen tial and discriminating policy,
        combined with other causes which cannot here be discussed, resulted in the Granger
        legislation of the 'seventies. In the first instance laws were enacted prescribing schedules
        of maximum freight and passenger rates with stringent penalties against rebates and
        discriminations. These measures proving unsatisfactory, they were soon superseded by
        statutes creating railway commissions with varied powers of regulation. The commission
        method of control was not a new one. Such bodies, established to appraise land for railway
        purposes, to apportion receipts and expenditures of interstate traffic, and in a general way
        to supervise railway transportation, had been in existence in New England before 1S60, one
        of the earliest being that of Rhode Island in 1839. In 1869 Massachusetts had instituted a
        commission of more modern type, which was given only powers of investigation and
        recommendation, the force of public opinion being relied upon to make its orders effective.
        Western commissions, the offspring of the Granger movement, were of a more vigorous type.
        Most of them had pow f er to impose schedules of maximum rates; practically all of them had
        authority to prescribe rates upon complaint of shippers; and they could all seek the aid of
        the courts to enforce their decrees. Their power to initiate rates, conferred upon them by
        their legislatures, was sustained by the Supreme Court of the United States, the Court
        reserving to itself only the power to decide whether the prescribed rates were
        reasonable.</p>
    <p> But the jurisdiction of the state commissions was, by judicial interpretation, limited to
        commerce beginning and ending within the limits- of the single state. The most important
        part of railway transportation, that which was interstate in character, was left untouched.
        It was this impotence of the state commission that furnished the strongest incentive to
        Congressional action. The result was the passage, in 1887, of the Interstate Commerce Act,
        which was directed towards the extirpation of illegal and unjust practices in commerce among
        the states. Its primary purpose was to embody in statutory form the common-law principle of
        equal treatment under like circumstances, and to provide machinery for enforcement. It aimed
        at the prohibition of discrimination between persons, places and commodities. It made
        provision for publicity of rates and for due notice of any change in rates; it forbade
        pooling of freight or earnings, and required annual reports from the carriers. For its
        enforcement, it created an Interstate Commerce Commission of five members, with powers of
        investigation, and with authority to issue remedial orders upon complaint and after hearing.
        Findings of the Commission were to be prima facie evidence in any court proceeding for the
        enforcement of its orders.</p>
    <p> In this connexion, reference should be made to the Anti-Trust Act of 1S90, which, by its
        judicial interpretation, has been held to include railways and to forbid rate agreements
        between competing carriers.</p>
    <p> The act of 1887 remained in force without substantial amendment until 1906, although with
        constantly diminishing prestige, a result largely due to adverse decisions concerning the
        powers of the Commission. Ten years after the passage of the law, the court decided that the
        Commission had no power to prescribe a rate, and that its jurisdiction over rates was
        confined to a determination of the question whether the rate complained of was unreasonable.
        The Commission had much difficulty at the beginning in securing the testimony of witnesses,
        who invoked the Constitution of the United States as a bar against selfincrimination, and
        the immunity clause of the act had to be amended before testimony could be obtained. The
        so-called “ long-and-short-haul clause," which forbade a greater charge for a long than for
        a short haul over the same line, if circumstances were substantially similar, was also
        robbed of all its vitality by court decision. The section requiring annual reports, while it
        led to the creation of a Bureau of Statistics, did not give</p>
    <p> the Commission power to compel complete or satisfactory answers to its requests for
        information. The only element of real strength that the statute acquired during the first
        twenty years of its history came from the Elkins Act of 1903, which stipulated that the
        published rate should be the legal rate, and declared any departure from the published rate
        to be a misdemeanour. It held shipper as well as carrier, and corporation as well as its
        officer or agent, liable for violations of the act, and conferred upon United States courts
        power to employ equity processes in putting an end to discrimination. Conviction for
        granting rebates was by this law made easier and more effective.</p>
    <p> Since igoo.—The movement in favour of more vigorous railway regulation became pronounced
        after 1900. Twenty years of experience and observation had revealed the defects of the
        earlier legislation, and had concentrated public attention more intelligently than ever
        before upon the problem of strengthening the weak spots. The state commissions, since their
        establishment in the ’seventies and the ’eighties, had increased their functions and
        influence. Many of them, beginning only with powers of recommendation, had obtained a large
        extension of authority. By 1908, thirty-five of the forty state commissions were of the
        mandatory type, and thirteen of these had been created since 1904. They had been given power
        to require complete annual reports from carriers, with a consequent great increase in public
        knowledge concerning railway operation and practice. The most recent type of state
        commission is the so-called Public Utility Commission, of which the best examples are those
        of New York and Wisconsin, established in 1907. In both states, the Commissions have power
        over electric railways and local public utilities furnishing heat, light and power, as well
        as over steam railway transportation, and the Wisconsin Commission also has control over
        telephone companies. In both states the consent of the Commission is necessary for the issue
        of corporate securities.</p>
    <p> Mention should be made of the mass of general legislation passed, principally by western
        states, since 1905, in response to a popular demand for lower rates. This demand has in many
        instances led to ill-considered legislation, has frequently ignored the prerogatives and
        even the existence of the state commissions, and has brought about the passage by state
        legislatures of maximum freight and passenger rate law's, with rates so low in many cases
        that they have been set aside by the courts as unconstitutional. The numerous law's limiting
        the fare for passengers to two cents per mile are an illustration of this tendency. *</p>
    <p> In the field of federal legislation, no significant change took place until the passage of
        the Hepburn Act of 1906, which was an amendment of the act of 1887. While failing to correct
        all the defects in the original statute, the amended law was a decided step in the direction
        of efficient regulation. It increased the jurisdiction of the Commission by placing under
        the act express companies, sleeping-car companies and pipe lines for the transportation of
        oil. It extended the meaning of the term “ railroad ” to include switches, spurs and
        terminal facilities, and the term “ transportation " to include private cars, and all
        collateral services, such as refrigeration, elevation and storage. The Elkins Act of 1903
        was incorporated in the statute, ^nd an imprisonment penalty was added to the existing fine.
        It forbade the granting of passes except to certain specified classes, —a provision entirely
        # absent from the original measure. It expressly conferred upon the Commission the power to
        prescribe maximum rates, upon complaint and after hearing, as well as to make joint rates,
        and to establish through rates when the carriers had themselves refused to do so. It enacted
        that published rates should not be changed except on thirty days’ notice, whether the change
        involved an increase or a decrease, and it required annual reports to be made under oath,
        penalties being prescribed for failure to comply with the Commission’s requests for
        information. Power w'as also given to prescribe uniform systems of accounts for all classes
        of carriers, and to employ special examiners to inspect the books and accounts. Carriers
        were forbidden to keep any accounts, records or memoranda other than those approved by the
        Commission.</p>
    <p> Orders of the Commission became effective within such time, not less than thirty days, as
        the Commission should prescribe, and penalties began to take effect from the date fixed by
        the Commission, unless the carrier secured an injunction from the Court suspending the
        order. Such injunction might not issue except after hearing, of which five days’ notice must
        be given. Decisions of the Commission were not revie wable by the Court unless the
        Commission had exceeded its authority, or had issued an unconstitutional order. </p>
    <p> A new and important act was signed by the President on the 18th of June 1910. It created a
        Commerce Court (composed of five judges nominated by the president of the United States from
        the Federal circuit judges), transferred to it jurisdiction in cases instituted to enforce
        or set aside orders of the Inter-State Commerce Commission, and made the United States
        instead of the Commission a party in all such actions. The law forbids a railway or any
        other common carrier to charge more for a short haul than for a long haul over the same
        line, unless, in special cases, it is authorized to do so by the Commission. It forbids a
        railway which has reduced its rates while in competition with a water route to raise them
        again when the competition has ceased, unless the Commission permits it to do so because of
        other changed conditions. It extends the initiative of the Commission from the investigation
        of complaints to the investigation of rates on its own motion; authorizes it to suspend
        rates in advance of their going into effect, pending an investigation which may be continued
        for ten months, and to establish through routes; and provides for a special commission,
        appointed by the President, to investigate questions pertaining to the issuance of railway
        securities. </p>

    <p> Accident Statistics </p>
    <p> Statistics of railway accidents may be divided into three classes: casualties (a) to
        passengers, (£) to servants or etnployés and ( c) to other persons; and again into (1) train
        accidents, </p>
    <p> (2) accidents to persons doing work on or about trains and </p>
    <p> (3) other accidents. </p>
    <p> Such statistics are studied mainly with the object of learning the lessons which they may
        afford as to preventive measures for the future; and from this point of view the most
        important element is the single item of passengers killed in train accidents (a 1). The
        number injured is, indeed, a fact of interest, no less than the number killed, but
        comparisons under this head are unsatisfactory because it is impracticable or unprofitable
        to go into sufficient detail to determine the relative seriousness of the injuries. The
        statistics of the killed usually afford all necessary stimulus to improvement. Accidents to
        passengers other than those caused by collisions or derailments of trains are very largely
        due to causes which it is fair to class either as unavoidable or as due mainly to the fault
        or carelessness of the victim himself. That this is so is indicated by the fact that,
        although the railways—always niade to suffer severely in pecuniary damages for injuries for
        which their officers or servants are held responsible by the courts—have for years taken
        almost every conceivable precaution, the number of accidents, in proportion to the number of
        persons travelling, diminishes but slowly—so slowly that, in view of the variety of
        conditions to be considered, it would hardly be safe to conclude that the diminution is due
        to any definite improvement in the safeguards provided. Collisions, on the other hand, are
        preventable, and derailments nearly so, and the records of deaths and injuries in this class
        in successive years are therefore justly taken as an index to the efficiency with which the
        railways are managed. </p>
    <p> The number of servants killed in train accidents is the next in importance. The safety of
        passengers is, indeed, the first care of the railway manager; but the employés , exposed to
        many risks from which the passengers are protected, must be looked after. On the British
        railways the men who run the trains are safeguarded very efficiently, and the collisions and
        derailments which are serious enough to do injury to the trainmen or the enginemen are
        really rare. The roadway, tracks and rolling stock are so well maintained that those causes
        which lead to the worst derailments have been eliminated almost completely, and the record
        of serious collisions has been reduced nearly to zero by the universal use of the block
        system and by systematic precautions at junctions. In America the record is far less
        satisfactory. The best railways of the United States and Canada have, indeed, been greatly
        improved, and their main lines approach the high standards of safety which prevail in Great
        Britain, both as regards maintenance and care of roadway and vehicles (as a preventive of
        derailments) and the use of the block system (as a preventive of collisions); but when the
        inquirer looks at America as a whole—the total length of lines in the United States being
        over 230,000 m., ten times the total of the United Kingdom—he is considering a figure which
        includes an enormous mileage of railway lying in thinly settled regions where the high
        standards of safety maintained on the best railways have scarcely been thought of. The duty
        of a railway with deficient plant or facilities would seem to be to make up for their
        absence by moderating the speeds of its trains, but public sentiment in America appears so
        far to have" approved, at least tacitly, the combination of imperfect railways and high
        speeds. </p>
    <p> Apart from collisions and derailments, a large proportion of all accidents is found to be
        due primarily to want of care on the part of the victims. Accidents to workmen in
        marshalling, shunting, distributing and running trains, engines and cars, may be taken as
        the most important class, after train accidents, because this work is necessary and
        important and yet involves considerable hazard. On British railways the duty of the
        companies to provide all practicable safeguards and to educate and caution the servants may
        be said to have been faithfully performed, and the accident totals must be taken as being
        somewhat near the “ irreducible minimum” —unless some of the infirmities of the human mind
        can be cured. In America the number of men killed and injured in handling freight trains has
        been very large. In the year ending June 30, 1909, exclusive of casualties due to
        collisions, derailments and other accidents to trains, the number killed was 811 and of
        injured 28,156 (Accident Bulletin , No. 32, p. 14). The number killed (811) is equal to
        about three in every thousand trainmen employed. From this and all other causes, the number
        of trainmen killed in the year ending June 30, 1909, was about 8 in 1000. </p>
    <p> The use of automatic couplers for freight cars throughout the United States, introduced in
        1893-1900, greatly reduced the number of deaths and injuries in coupling, and the use of air
        brakes on freight cars, now universal, has reduced the risk to the men by making it less
        necessary for them to ride on the roofs of high box-cars, while at the same time it has made
        it possible to run long trains with fewer men; but except in these two features the freight
        service in America continues to be a dangerous occupation. The high and heavy cars, the high
        speeds, the severe weather in the northern states in winter, the fluctuating nature of the
        business, resulting often in the employment of poorly qualified men and in other
        irregularities, are among the causes of this state of things. </p>
    <p> Being struck or run over by a train while standing or walking on the track is the largest
        single cause of “ railway accidents.” Workmen are killed and injured in this way, both while
        on duty and when going to and from their work; passengers, with or without right, go in
        front of trains at stations and at highway crossings at grade level; and trespassers are
        killed and injured in large numbers on railways everywhere, at and near stations, at
        crossings, and out on the open road, where they have no shadow of right. Of trespassers the
        number killed per' mile of </p>
    <p> line is about as large in England as in America, the density of population and of traffic in
        Great Britain apparently counterbalancing the laxity of the laws against trespassing in
        America. In the thickly settled parts of the United States the number of trespassers killed
        on the railway tracks, including vagrants who sufTer in collisions and derailments while
        stealing rides, is very large. In New York and four adjacent states, having about as many
        miles of railway as the United Kingdom, the number in the year ending June 30, 1907, was
        1552. In the United Kingdom the number for the corresponding year was 447, or less than
        one-third.</p>
    <p> As was suggested at the outset, railway accident statistics are useful only as showing how
        to make life and limb safer, though in pursuing this object increased economy should also be
        secured. Railways have always been held by the legislatures and by the courts strictly
        accountable for their shortcomings, so far as accountability can be enforced by compelling
        the payment of damages to victims of accidents; but in spite of this, a want of enterprise
        and even some apparent neglect of passengers* and servants* plain rights, have often been
        apparent, and the Board of Trade, with its powers of supervision, inspection and
        investigation, must therefore be classed as one of the most beneficent factors in the
        promotion of safety on British railways. Its powers have been exercised with the greatest
        caution, yet with consistent firmness; and the publicity which has been given to the true
        and detailed causes of scores and scores of railway accidents by the admirable reports of
        the Board of Trade inspectors has been a powerful lever in improving the railway service.
        Useful compulsory laws regarding the details of train management are difficult to frame and
        hard to carry out; but the Board has exercised a persistent persuasiveness and has secured
        most of its objects. Its investigations justified the law making the block system
        compulsory, thus removing the worst danger of railway travel. Its constant and impartial
        expositions of cases of over-work and insufficient training of employes have greatly helped
        to elevate the character of these employes.</p>
    <p> In the United States the governments have done far less. A majority of the states have
        railway commissions, but the investigation of railway accidents, with comparatively few
        exceptions, has not been done in such a way as to make the results 1 useful in promoting
        improved practice. Many of the commissions have done little or nothing of value in this
        respect. The Federal government, having authority in railway matters only when interstate
        traffic is affected, gathers statistics and publishes them; but in the airing of causes—the
        field in which the British Board of Trade has been so useful—nothing so far has been done
        except to require written reports monthly from the railways. These are useful so far as they
        go, but they lack the impartiality that would be secured by an inquiry such as is held in
        England.</p>

    <p> The casualties enumerated in items 1, 4 and 7 of Table X. aggregate 6 killed and 454injured;
        the six deaths were due to collisions, while of the cases of injury 372 occurred by
        collisions, 47 by derailments, and 35 by other accidents to trains. This undoubtedly is the
        greatest record for train safety ever known in the world. Item^i shows no passengers killed
        in train accidents during the year.^ This was the case once before, in 1901; and the total
        of fatal accidents to passengers and servants, taken together, has in several years been
        very low (1896, eight; 1901, eight; 1902, ten; 1904, thirteen), but never before was it down
        to six.</p>

    <p> Percentages .—On British railways the casualties from train accidents, especially fatal
        injuries, have been reduced to so small a proportion of the number of passengers travelling,
        or the number of </p>
    <p> servants employed, that the figures showing the percentages vary from year to year
        considerably; but in other classes of accidents, in which a large proportion of the cases
        may be classed asunprevent-able, the percentages do not vary greatly. The following are the
        more significant ratios in the year 1907, as shown in the Board of Trade returns:— </p>

    <p> Railway Accidents in America .—The statistics of accidents in America are kept in a form
        somewhat different from the foregoing. Table XIV. is taken from the Accident Bulletin of the
        Interstate Commerce Commission (No. 32), the items being numbered to correspond as nearly as
        practicable with the numbers in the British table (No. X.). The items 7-8 embrace the
        statistics which most nearly correspond to the items 7-12 in the British table. </p>

    <p> The salient feature of Table XIV. is the diminution from 1908 to 1909. This is mainly due to
        a great falling off in traffic, because of a general business depression; from 1907 to 1909
        the reduction in the accident record is still greater. In items 1 and 4 the increase in
        safety is due in part, no doubt, to the extension of the use of the block system. The
        accidents to " other persons ” cannot readily be compared with items 7-12 in the British
        record, except as to the totals and a few of the items. </p>
    <p> In any comparison ^ between British and American records the first point to be borne in mind
        is the difference in mileage and traffic. The American railways aggregate approximately ten
        times the length of the British lines; but in train miles the difference is far less. In the
        latest years in which comparisons can be made, the passenger journeys in the United Kingdom
        amounted to 1500 millions (including season-ticket holders, estimated) and the train miles
        to 428-3 millions, while the corresponding figures in the United States were 873-9 millions
        and 1171-9 millions. The average length </p>
    <p> of the passenger's journey in the United States is reported to be about 32 m.; in Great
        Britain it is undoubtedly jess, but no record is published. Of the total train mileage in
        America more than half is freight; in Great Britain much more than half is passenger.</p>

    <p> Table XV. shows the casualties on American railways in 1907 and 1008 (year ending June 30).
        These figures differ from those in Table XIV. because of differences in classification. In
        Table XIV. the item " passengers killed " includes those on some electric railways, which
        presumably are not covered in the statement here given; also passengers in freight trains,
        &amp;c. Under " employees M this table includes men in shops, &amp;c., not shown in Table
        XIV.</p>
    <p> In 1907 one passenger in 2,318,051 was killed, and one in 107,001 was injured, in train
        accidents. The number of employis killed in train accidents was 12-9 in 10 million train
        miles. Of train men (including engine-drivers and firemen), one out of 125 employed was
        killed (all causes), and one in eight injured.</p>
    <p> The great differences between the records of the United States and the United Kingdom seem
        to afford justification for the view, which has often been expressed, that in America the
        spirit of hurry and recklessness manifest in many of the activities of the people prevails
        even among the men on whom rests the grave responsibility of running trains in safety. Yet
        the best safety devices arc made in America, and means of reducing these death records are
        well known.</p>
    <p> France.—Railway accidents in France are recorded in a shape somewhat different from that
        found in either Great Britain or America. The principal items for the years 1906 and 1907
        are shown in Table XVI. The length of railways in the republic was 39,963 km. (24,832 m.),
        the number of persons employed on them was rather less than 300,000, the number of
        passengers carried annually being between 450 and 500 millions. The number of passengers
        (36) killed in train accidents in 1907 was equal to 0-0759 P er million passengers carried
        and 0-0024 per million kilometres travelled by passengers, or 0-1503 per million kilometres
        travelled by trains.</p>

    <p> The most significant item in the table, 36 passengers killed in train accidents, is perhaps
        to be considered as abnormally large, the totals under this head for the preceding six years
        beginning with 19o1 being 7, 35, 3, 18, 4, 14, or an average of 11-57 per year. The French
        secretary of Public Works, who has furnished these statistics, keeps also similar records of
        the local or light railways, on which the number of fatal accidents appears to be
        exceedingly small.</p>
    <p> Germany.—The number of persons killed on the railways of the German Empire in the year 1907
        was 1249, classified as in Table XVII. This number does not include suicides and attempts at
        suicide, of which there were 333, all but 24 being successful. In these statistics, the
        third item, “ other persons,” includes post office and customs officials and other persons
        connected with the railway service, as well as railway officers and servants off duty. The
        totals of passengers killed and</p>
    <p> injured in train accidents are not separated from those killed and injured from other
        causes, but ratios are given showing that for four years no passengers were killed in this
        class.</p>

    <p> See the Quarterly and Annual Reports, issued by the Board of Trade, London, and the Annual
        Statistical Reports and Quarterly Accident Bulletins, published by the Interstate Commerce
        Commission, Washington. (B. B. A.)</p>
    <p> Financial Organization</p>
    <p> The methods of financing railway enterprises, both new projects and existing lines, have
        been influenced very largely by the attitude of the state and of municipal authorities.
        Railways may be built for military reasons or for commercial reasons, or for a combination
        of the two. The Trans-Siberian railway was a military necessity if Russia was to exercise
        dominion throughout Siberia and maintain a port on the Yellow Sea or the Sea of Japan. The
        Union Pacific railroad was a military necessity to the. United States if the authority of
        the national government was to be maintained in the Far West. The cost of such ventures and
        the detailed methods by which they are financed are of relatively small importance, because
        they are not required to earn a money return on the investment. To a less degree, the same
        is true of railways built for a special instead of a general commercial interest. The
        Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroad was built to protect and further the commercial interests of
        the city of Baltimore; the Cincinnati Southern railway is still owned by the city of
        Cincinnati, which built the line in the ’seventies for commercial protection against
        Louisville, Ky. From a commercial point of view such ventures are differentiated from
        railway projects built for general commercial reasons because they do not depend on their
        own credit. The government, national or local, furnishes the borrowing power, and makes the
        best bargain it can with the men it designates to operate the line.</p>
    <p> Where a railway is built for general commercial reasons, however, it must furnish its own
        credit; that is to say, it must convince investors that it can be worked profitably and give
        them an assured return on the funds they advance. The state is interested in the commercial
        railway venture as a matter of public policy, and because it can confer or withold the right
        of eminent domain, without which the railway builder would be subjected to endless annoyance
        and expense. This governmental sanction has been obtainable only with difficulty, and after
        the exercise of numerous legal forms, in Great Britain and on the continent of Europe. In
        the United States, on the other hand, it has been obtained with considerable ease. In the
        earlier years of American railway building, each project was commonly the subject of a
        special law; then special laws were in turn succeeded by general railway laws in the several
        states, and these in turn have come to be succeeded in most parts of the country by
        jurisdiction vested in the state railway commission. Each of these changes has tended to
        improve the existing status, to legitimize railway enterprise, and to safeguard capital or
        investment.</p>
    <p> The law's regulating original outputs for capital were strictly drawn in Great Britain and
        on the continent of Europe; in America they were drawn very loosely. As a result it has been
        far easier for the American than for the European railway builder to take advantage of the
        speculative instinct in obtaining money. Instead of the borrowing power being restricted to
        a small percentage of the total capital, as in European countries, most of the railway
        mileage of America has been built with borrowed money, represented by bonds, while stock has
        been given freely as an inducement to subscribe to the bonds on the</p>
    <p> theory that the bonds represented the cost of the enterprise, and the stock the prospective
        profits. As a natural result weak railway companies in the United States have frequently
        been declared insolvent by the courts, owing to their inability in periods of commercial
        depression to meet their acknowledged obligations, and in the reorganization which has
        followed the shareholders have usually had to accept a loss, temporary or permanent. </p>
    <p> The situation in Great Britain has been wholly different. The debt in that country is
        relatively small in amount, and is not represented by securities based upon hypothecation of
        the company’s real property, as with the American railway bond, resting on a first, second
        or third mortgage. But British share capital has been issued so freely for extension and
        improvement work of all sorts, including the costly requirements of the .Board of Trade,
        that a situation has been reached where the return on the outstanding securities tends to
        diminish year by year. Although this fact will not in itself make the companies liable to
        any process of reorganization similar to that following insolvency and foreclosure of the
        American railway, it is probable that reorganization of some sort must nevertheless take
        place in Great Britain, and it may well be questioned whether the position of the
        transportation system of that country, would not have been better if it had been built up
        and projected on the experience gained by actual earlier losses, as in the United States. </p>
    <p> Thus the characteristic defect in the British railway organization has been the tendency to
        put out new capital at a rate faster than has been warranted by the annual increases in
        earnings. The American railways do not have to face this situation; but, after a long term
        of years, when they were allowed to do much as they pleased, they have now been brought
        sharply to book by almost every form of constituted authority to be found in the states, and
        they are suffering from increased taxation, from direct service requirements, and from a
        general tendency on the part of regulating authorities to reduce rates and to make it
        impossible to increase them. Meantime, the purchasing power of the dollar which the railway
        company receives for a specified service is gradually growing smaller, owing to the general
        increases year by year in wages and in the cost of material. The railways are prospering
        because they are managed with great skill and are doing increasing amounts of business,
        though at lessening unit profits. But there is danger of their reaching the point where
        there is little or no margin between emit costs of service and unit receipts for the
        service. It will probably be inevitable for American railway rates to trend somewhat upward
        in the future, as they have gradually declined in the past; but the process apparently
        cannot be accomplished without considerable friction with the governing authorities. The
        attitude of the courts is not that the railways should work without compensation, but that
        the compensation should not exceed a fair return on funds actually expended by the railway.
        This is in line with the provisions in the Constitution of the United States regarding the
        protection of property, but the difficulty in applying the principle to the railway
        situation lies in the· fact that costs have to be met by averaging the returns on the total
        amount of business done, and it is often impossible, in specific instances, to secure a rate
        which can be considered to yield a fair return on the specific service rendered. Hence
        losses in one quarter must be compensated by gains in another—a process which the law,
        regarding only the gains, renders very difficult. </p>
    <p> The growth of railways has been accompanied by a world-wide tendency toward the
        consolidation of small independent ventures into large groups of lines able to aid one
        another in the exchange of traffic and to effect economies in administration and in the
        purchase of supplies. Both in England and in America this process of consolidation has been
        obstructed by all known legislative devices, because of the widespread belief that
        competition in the field of transportation was necessary if fair prices were to be charged
        for the service. But the general tendency to regulate rates by authority of the state has
        apparently rendered unnecessary the old plan of rate regulation through competition, even if
        it had not been demonstrated often and again that this form of regulation is costly for all
        concerned and is effective only during rare periods of direct conflict between companies.
        Nevertheless, in spite of difficulties, consolidation has gone on with great rapidity. When
        Mr E. H. Harriman died he exercised direct authority over more than 50,000 m. of railway,
        and the tendency of all the great American railway systems, even when not tied to one
        another in common ownership, is to increase their mileage year by year by acquiring
        tributary lines. The smaller company exchanges its stock for stock of the larger system on
        an agreed basis, or sells it outright, and the bondholders of the absorbed line often have a
        similar opportunity to exchange their securities for obligations of the parent company,
        which are on a stronger basis or have a broader market. Similarly in Great Britain there is
        a tendency towards combination by mutual agreement among the companies while they still
        preserve their independent existence. </p>

    <p> Construction </p>
    <p> Location .—An ideal line of railway connecting two terminal points would be perfectly level
        and perfectly straight, because in that case the resistance due to gradients and curves
        would be eliminated (see § Locomotive Power) and the cost of mechanical operation reduced to
        a minimum. But that ideal is rarely if ever attainable. In the first place the route of a
        railway must be governed by commercial considerations. Unless it be quite short, it can
        scarcely ever be planned simply to connect its two terminal points, without regard to the
        intervening country; in order to be of the greatest utility and to secure the greatest
        revenue it must be laid out with due consideration of the traffic </p>
    <p> arising at intermediate places, and as these will not usually lie exactly on the direct
        line, deviations from straightness will be rendered necessary. In the second place, except
        in the unlikely event of all the places on the selected route lying at the same elevation, a
        line that is perfectly level is a physical impossibility; and from engineering
        considerations, even one with uniform gradients will be impracticable on the score of cost,
        unless the surface of the country is extraordinarily even. In these circumstances the
        constructor has two broad alternatives between which to choose. On the one hand he may make
        the line follow the natural inequalities of the ground as nearly as may be, avoiding the
        elevations and depressions by curves; or on the other he may aim at making it as nearly
        straight and level as possible by taking it through the elevations in cuttings or tunnels
        and across the depressions on embankments or bridges. He will incline to the first of these
        alternatives when cheapness of first cost is a desideratum, but, except in unusually
        favourable circumstances, the resulting line, being full of sharp curves and severe
        gradients, will be unsuited for fast running and will be unable to accommodate heavy traffic
        economically. If, however, cost within reasonable limits is a secondary consideration and
        the intention is to build a line adapted for express trains and for the carriage of the
        largest volume of traffic with speed and economy, he will lean towards the second. In
        practice every line is a compromise between these two extremes, arrived at by carefully
        balancing a large number of varying factors. Other things being equal, that route is best
        which mil serve the district most conveniently and secure the highest revenue; and the most
        favourable combination of curves and gradients is that by which the annual cost of conveying
        the traffic which the line will be called on to carry, added to the annual interest on the
        capital expended in construction, will be made a minimum.</p>
    <p> Cuttings and Embankments.—A cutting, or cut, is simply a trench dug in a hill or piece of
        rising ground, wide enough at the bottom to accommodate one or more pairs of rails, and deep
        enough to enable the line to continue its course on the level or on a moderate gradient. The
        slopes of the sides vary according to the nature of the ground, the amount of moisture
        present, &amp;c. In solid rock they may be vertical; in gravel, sand or common earth they
        must, to prevent slipping, rise i ft. for i to ii or 2 ft. of base, or even more in
        treacherous clay. In soft material the excavation may be performed by mechanical excavators
        or “ steam navvies,” while in hard it may be necessary to resort to blasting. Except in hard
        rock* the top width of a cutting, and therefore the amount of material to be excavated,
        increases rapidly with the depth; hence if a cutting exceeds a certain depth, which varies
        with the particular circumstances, it may be more economical, instead of forming the sides
        at the slope at which the material of which they are composed will stand, to make them
        nearly vertical and support the soil with a retaining wall, or to bore a tunnel. An
        embankment-bank, or fill, is the reverse of a cutting, being an artificial mound of earth on
        which the railway is taken across depressions in the surface of the ground. An endeavour is
        made so to plan the works of a railway that the quantity of earth excavated in cuttings
        shall be equal to the quantity required for the embankments; but this is not always
        practicable, and it is sometimes advantageous to obtain the earth from some source close to
        the embankment rather than incur the expense of hauling it from a distant cutting. As
        embankments have to support the weight of heavy trains, they must be uniformly firm and well
        drained, and before the line is fully opened for traffic they must be allowed time to
        consolidate, a process which is helped by running construction or mineral trains over
        them.</p>
    <p> An interesting case of embankment and cutting in combination was involved in crossing Chat
        Moss on the Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway. The moss was 4$ m. across, and it varied in
        depth from 10 to 30 ft. Its general character was such that cattle could not stand on it,
        and a piece of iron would sink in it. The subsoil was composed principally of clay and sand,
        and the railway had to be earned over the moss on the level, requiring cutting, and
        embanking</p>
    <p> for upwards of 4 m. In forming 277,000 cub. yds. of embankment 670,000 yds. 01 raw peat were
        consumed, the difference being occasioned by the squeezing out of the water. Large
        quantities of embanking were sunk in the moss, and, when the engineer, George Stephenson,
        after a month’s vigorous operations, had made up his estimates, the apparent work done was
        sometimes less than at the beginning of the month. The railway ultimately was made to float
        on the bog. Where embankment was required drains about 5 yds. apart were cut, and when the
        moss between them was dry it was used to form the embankment. Where the way was formed on
        the level, drains were cut on each side of the intended line, and were intersected here and
        there by cross drains, by which the upper "part of the moss was rendered dry and firm. On
        this surface hurdles were placed, 4 ft. broad and 9 long, covered with heath, upon which the
        ballast was laid.</p>
    <p> Bridges.—For conveying small streams through embankments, channels or culverts arc
        constructed in brickwork or masonry. Larger rivers, canals, roads, other railways and
        sometimes deep narrow valleys are crossed by bridges (q.v.) of timber, brick, stone, wrought
        iron or steel, and many of these structures rank among the largest engineering works in the
        world. Sometimes also a viaduct consisting of a series of arches is preferred to an
        embankment when the line has to be taken over a piece of flat alluvial plain, or when it is
        desired to economize space and to carry the line at a sufficient height to clear the
        streets, as in the case of various railways entering London and other large towns. In
        connexion with a railway many bridges have also to be constructed to carry public roads and
        other railways over the line, and for the use of owners or tenants whose land it has cut
        through (“ accommodation bridges ”). In the early days of railways, roads were often taken
        across the line on the level, but such “ level ” or “ grade ” crossings are now usually
        avoided in the case of new lines in populous countries, except when the traffic on both the
        road and the railway is very light. In many instances old level crossings have been replaced
        by over-bridges with long sloping approaches; in this way considerable expenditure has been
        involved, justified, however, by the removal of a danger to the public and of interruptions
        to the traffic on both the roads and the railways. In cases where the route of a line runs
        across a river or other piece of water so wide that the construction of a bridge is either
        impossible or would be more costly than is warranted by the volume of traffic, the expedient
        is sometimes adopted of carrying the wagons and carriages across bodily with their loads on
        train ferries, so as to avoid the inconvenience and delay of transshipment. Such train
        ferries arc common in America, especially on the Great Lakes, and exist at several places in
        Europe, as in the Baltic between Denmark and Sweden and Denmark and Germany, and across the
        Straits of Messina.</p>
    <p> Gradients.—The gradient or grade of a line is the rate at which it rises or falls, above or
        below the horizontal, and is expressed by stating either the horizontal distance in which
        the change of level amounts to 1 ft., or the amount of change that would occur in some
        selected distance, such as 100 ft., 1000 ft. or i m. In America a gradient of 1 in 100 is
        often known as a 1% grade, one of 2 in 100 as a 2% grade, and so on; thus a 0-25% grade
        corresponds to what in England would be known as a gradient of 1 in 400. The ruling gradient
        of a section of railway is the steepest incline in that section, and is so called because it
        governs or rules the maximum load that can be placed behind an engine working over that
        portion of line. Sometimes, however, a sharp incline occurring on an otherwise easy line is
        not reckoned as the ruling gradient, trains heavier than could be drawn up it by a single
        engine being helped by an assistant or “ bank ” engine; sometimes also “ momentum ” or “
        velocity ” grades, steeper than the ruling gradient, are permitted for short distances in
        cases where a train can approach at full speed and thus surmount them by the aid of its
        momentum. An incline of 1 in 400 is reckoned easy, of 1 in 200 moderate and of τ in 100
        heavy. The ruling gradient of the Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway was fixed at τ in 900,
        excepting the inclines at Liverpool and at Rainhill summit, for working which special
        provision was made; and I. K. Brunei laid out the Great Western for a long distance</p>
    <p> out of London'with a ruling gradient of i in 1320. Other engineers, however, such as Joseph
        Locke, cheapened the cost of construction by admitting long slopes of 1 in 80 or 70, One of
        the steepest gradients in England on an important line is the Lickey incline at Bromsgrove,
        on the Midland railway between Birmingham and Gloucester, where the slope is 1 in 37 for two
        miles. The maximum gradient possible depends on climatic conditions, a dry climate being the
        most favourable. The theoretical limit is about 1 in 16; between 1 in 20 and 1 in 16 a steam
        locomotive depending on the adhesion between its wheels and the rails can only haul about
        its own weight. In practice the gradient should not exceed 1 in 22J, and even that is too
        steep, since theoretical conditions cannot always be realized; a wet rail will reduce the
        adhesion, and the gradients must be such that some paying load can be hauled in all
        weathers. When an engineer has to construct a railway up a hill having a still steeper
        slope, he must secure practicable gradients by laying out the line in ascending spirals, if
        necessary tunnelling into the hill, as on the St Gothard railway, or in a series of zigzags,
        or he must resort to a rack or a cable railway. </p>
    <p> Rack Railways .—In rack railways a cog-wheel on the engine engages in a toothed rack which
        forms part of the permanent way. The earliest arrangement of this kind was patented by John
        Blen-kinsop, of the Middleton Colliery, near Leeds, in 1811, and an engine built on his plan
        by Mathew Murray, also of Leeds, began in 1812 to haul coals from Middleton to Leeds over a
        line 3i m. long. Blen-kinsop placed the teeth on the outer side of one of the running rails,
        and his reason for adopting a rack was the belief that an engine with smooth wheels running
        on smooth rails would not have sufficient 'adhesion to draw the load required. It was not
        till more than half a century later that an American, Sylvester Marsh, employed the rack
        system for the purpose of enabling trains to surmount steep slopes on the Mount Washington
        railway, where the maximum gradient was nearly 1 in 2J. In this case the rack had pin teeth
        carried in a pair of angle bars. The subsequent development of rack railways is especially
        associated with a Swiss engineer, Nicholas Riggenbach, and his pupil Roman Abt, and the
        forms of rack introduced by them are those most commonly used. That of the latter is
        multiple, several rack-plates being placed parallel to each other, and the teeth break joint
        at i, i or J of their pitch, according to the number of rack-plates. In this way smbothness
        of working is ensured, the cog-wheel being constantly in action with the rack. Abt also
        developed the plan of combining rack and adhesional working, the engine working by adhesion
        alone on the gentler slopes but by both adhesion and the rack on the steeper ones. On such
        lines the beginning of a rack section is provided with a piece of rack mounted on springs,
        so that the pinions of the engine engage smoothly with the teeth. Racks of this type usually
        become impracticable for gradients steeper than 1 in 4, partly because of the excessive
        weight of the engine required and partly because of the tendency of the cog-wheel to mount
        the rack. The Locher rack, employed on the Mount Pilatus railway, where the steepest
        gradient is nearly 1 in 2, is double, with vertical teeth on each side, while in the St rub
        rack, used on the Jungfrau line, the teeth are cut in the head of a rail of the ordinary
        Vignoles type. </p>
    <p> Cable Railways .—For surmounting still steeper slopes, cable railways may be employed. Of
        these there are two main systems: (1) a continuous cable is carried over two main drums at
        each end of the line, and the motion is derived cither (a) from the weight of the descending
        load or (6) from a motor acting on one of the main drums; (2) each end of the cable is
        attached to wagons, one set of which accordingly ascends as the other descends. The weight
        required to cause the downward motion is obtained either by means of the material which has
        to be transported to the bottom of the hill or by water ballast, while to aid and regulate
        the motion generally steam or electric motors are arranged to act on the main drums, round
        which the cable is passed with a sufficient number of turns to prevent slipping. When water
        ballast is employed the water is filled into a tank in the bottom of the wagon or car, its
        quantity, if passengers are carried, being regulated by the number ascending or descending. </p>
    <p> Curves .—The curves on railways are either simple, when they consist of a portion of the
        circumference of a single circle, or compound, when they are made up of portions of the
        circumference of two or more circles of different radius. Reverse curves are compound curves
        in which the components are of contrary flexure, like the letter S; strictly the term is
        only applicable when the two portions follow directly one on the other, but it is sometimes
        used of cases in which they are separated by a “ tangent ” or portion of straight line. In
        Great Britain the curvature is defined by stating the length of </p>
    <p> the radius, expressed in chains (i chain = 66 ft.), in America by stating the angle
        subtended by a chord 100 ft. long; the measurements in both methods are referred to the
        central line of the track. The radius of a i-degree curve is 5730 ft., or about 86f chains,
        of a 15-degree curve 383 ft. or rather less than 6 chains; the former is reckoned easy, the
        latter very sharp, at least for main lines on the standard gauge. On some of the earlier
        English main lines no curves were constructed of a less radius than a mile (80 chains),
        except at places where the speed was likely to be low, but in later practice the radius is
        sometimes reduced to 40 or 30 chains, even on high-speed passenger lines. </p>
    <p> When a train is running round a curve the centrifugal force which comes into play tends to
        make its wheel-flanges press against the outer rail, or even to capsize it. If this pressure
        is not relieved in some way, the train may be derailed either (1) by “ climbing ” the outer
        rail, with injury to that rail and, generally, to the corresponding wheel-flanges; (2) by
        overturning about the outer rail as a hinge, possibly without injury to rails or wheels; or
        (3) by forcing the outer rail outwards, occasionally to the extent of shearing the spikes
        that hold it down at the curve, thus spreading or destroying the track. In any case the
        details depend upon whether the vehicle concerned is an engine, a wagon or a passenger
        coach, and upon whether it runs on bogie-trucks or not. If it is an engine, particular
        attention must be directed to the type, weight, arrangement of wheels and height of centre
        of gravity above rail level. In considering the forces that produce derailment the total
        mass of the vehicle or locomotive may be supposed to be concentrated at its centre of
        gravity. Two lines may be drawn from this point, one to each of the two rails, in a plane
        normal to the rails, and the ends of these lines, where they meet the rails, may be joined
        to complete a triangle, which may conveniently be regarded as a rigid frame resting on the
        rails. As the vehicle sweeps round the curve the centre of gravity tends to be thrown
        outwards, like a stone from a horizontal sling. The vertical pressure of the frame upon the
        outer rail is thus increased, while its vertical pressure on the inner rail is diminished.
        Simultaneously the frame as a whole tends to slide horizontally athwart the rails, from the
        inner towards the outer rail, urged by the same centrifugal forces. This sliding movement is
        resisted by placing a check rail on the inner side of the inner rail, to take the lateral
        thrust of the wheels on that side. It is also resisted in part by the conicity of the
        wheels, which converts the lateral force partly into a vertical force, thus enabling gravity
        to exert a restoring influence. When the lateral forces are too great to be controlled “
        climbing ” occurs. Accidents due to simple climbing are, however, exceedingly rare, and are
        usually found associated with a faulty track, with “ plunging ” movements of the locomotive
        or vehicle, or with a “ tight gauge ” at curves or points. </p>
    <p> From consideration of the rigid triangular frame described above, it is clear that the “
        overturning ” force acts horizontally from the centre of gravity, and that the length of its
        lever arm is, at any instant, the vertical distance from the centre of gravity to the level
        of the outer rail. This is true whatever be the tilt of the vehicle at that instant. The
        restoring force exerted by gravity acts in a vertical line from the centre of gravity; and
        the length of its lever arm is the horizontal distance between this vertical line and the
        outer rail. If therefore the outer rail is laid at a level above that of the inner rail at
        the curve, overturning will be resisted more than would be the case if both rails were in
        the same horizontal plane, since the tilting of the vehicle due to this “ superelevation ”
        diminishes the overturning moment, and also increases the restoring moment, by shortening in
        the one case and lengthening in the other the lever arms at which the respective forces act.
        The amount of superelevation required to prevent derailment at a curve can be calculated
            <ref xml:id="r1" target="n1">1</ref><note xml:id="n1" n="1"> See The Times Engineering
            Supplement (August 22, 1906), p. 265.</note> under perfect running conditions, given the
        radius of curvature, the weight of the vehicle, the height of the centre of gravity, the
        distance between the rails, and the speed; but great experience </p>
    <p> is required for the successful application of definite formulae to the problem. For example,
        what is a safe speed at a given curve for an engine, truck or coach having the load equally
        distributed over the wheels may lead to either climbing or overturning if the load is
        shifted to a diagonal position. An ill-balanced load also exaggerates “ plunging,” and if
        the period of oscillation of the load happens to agree with the changes of contour or other
        inequalities of the track vibrations of a dangerous character, giving rise to so-called “
        sinuous ” motion, may occur.</p>
    <p> In general it is not curvature, but change of curvature, that presents difficulty in the
        laying-out of a line. For instance, if the curve is of S-form, the point of danger is when
        the train enters the contra-flexure, and it is not an easy matter to assign * the best
        superelevation at all points throughout the double bend. Closely allied to the question of
        safety is the problem of preventing jolting at curves; and to obtain easy running it is
        necessary not merely to adjust the levels of the rails in respect to one another, but to
        tail off one curve into the next in such a manner as to avoid any approach to abrupt lateral
        changes of direction. With increase of speeds this matter has become important as an element
        of comfort in passenger traffic. As a first approximation, the centre-line of a railway may
        be plotted out as a number of portions of circles, with intervening straight tangents
        connecting them, when the abruptness of the changes of direction will depend on the radii of
        the circular portions. But if the change from straight to circular is made through the
        medium of a suitable curve it is possible to relieve the abruptness, even on curves of
        comparatively small radius. The smoothest and safest running is, in fact, attained when a “
        transition,” “ easement ” or “ adjustment ” curve is inserted between the tangent and the
        point of circular curvature.</p>

        Existing Railway Curves,” by W. H. Shortt, Proc. Inst. C.E. vol. 176, part ii.</p>
    <p> Gauge.—The gauge of a railway is the distance between the inner edges of the two rails upon
        which the wheels run. The width of 4 ft. 8J in. may be regarded as standard, since it
        prevails on probably three-quarters of the railways of the globe. In North America, except
        for small industrial railways and some short lines for local traffic, chiefly in mountainous
        country, it has become almost universal; the long lines of</p>
    <p> 3 ft. gauge have mostly been converted, or a third rail has been laid to permit interchange
        of vehicles, and the gauges of 5 ft. and more have disappeared. A considerable number of
        lines still Use</p>
    <p> 4 ft. 9 in., but as their rolling stock runs freely on the 4 ft. 8£ in. gauge and vice
        versa, this does not constitute a break of gauge for traffic purposes. The commercial
        importance of such free interchange of traffic is the controlling factor in determining the
        gauge of any new railway that is not isolated by its geographical position. In Great Britain
        railways are built to gauges other than 4 ft. 8| in. only under exceptional conditions; the
        old “ broad gauge ” of 7 ft. which I. K. Brunei adopted for the Great Western railway
        disappeared on the 2oth-23rd of May 1892, when the main line from London to Penzance was
        converted to standard gauge throughout its length. In Ireland the usual gauge is 5 ft. 3
        in., but there are also lines laid to a</p>
    <p> 3 ft. gauge. On the continent of Europe the standard gauge is generally adopted, though in
        France there are many miles of</p>
    <p> 4 ft. 9 in. gauge; the normal Spanish and Portuguese gauge is, however, 5 ft. 5} in., and
        that of Russia 5 ft. In France and other European countries there is also an important
        mileage of metre gauge, and even narrower, on lines of local or secondary importance. In
        India the prevailing gauge is 5 ft. 6 in., but there is a large mileage of other gauges,
        especially metre. In the British colonies the prevailing gauge is 3 ft. 6 in., as in South
        Africa, Queensland, Tasmania and New Zealand; but in New South Wales the normal is 4 ft. 8J
        in. and in Victoria</p>
    <p> 5 ft. 3 in., communication between different countries of the</p>
    <p> Australian Commonwealth being thus carried on under the disadvantage of break of gauge.
        Though the standard gauge is in use in Lower Egypt, the line into the Egyptian Sudan was
        built on a gauge of 3 ft. 6. in., so that if the so-called Cape to Cairo railway is ever
        completed, there will be one gauge from Upper Egypt to Cape Town. In South America the 5 ft.
        6 in. gauge is in use, with various others.</p>
    <p> Mono-Rail Systems.—The gauge may be regarded as reduced to its narrowest possible dimensions
        in mono-rail lines, where the weight of the trains is carried on a single rail. This method
        of construction, however, has been* adopted only to a very limited extent. In the Lartigue
        system the train is straddled over a single central rail, elevated a suitable distance above
        the ground. A short fine of this kind runs from Ballybunnion to Listowel in Ireland, and a
        more ambitious project on the same principle, on the plans of Air F. B. Behr, to connect
        Liverpool and Alanchester, was sanctioned by Parliament in 1901. In this case electricity
        was to be the motive-power, and speeds exceeding 100 m. an hour were to be attained, but the
        line has not been built. In the Langen mono-rail the cars are hung from a single overhead
        rail; a line on this system works between Barmen and Elberfeld, about 9 m., the cars for a
        portion of the distance being suspended over the river Wupper. In the system devised by Air
        Louis Brennan the cars run on a single rail laid on the ground, their stability being
        maintained by a heavy gyrostat revolving at great speed in a vacuum.</p>
    <p> I Permanent Way.—When the earth-works of a line have been completed and the tops of the
        embankments and the bottoms of the cuttings brought to the level decided upon, the next step
        is to lay the permanent way, so-called probably in distinction to the temporary way used
        during construction. The first step is to deposit a layer of ballast on the road-bed or “
        formation,” which often slopes away slightly on each side from the central line to
        facilitate drainage. The ballast consists of such materials as broken stone, furnace slag,
        gravel, cinders or earth, the lower layers commonly consisting of coarser materials than the
        top ones, and its purpose is to provide a firm, well-drained foundation in which the
        sleepers or crossties may be embedded and held in place, and by which the weight of the
        track and the trains may be distributed over the road-bed. Its depth varies, according to
        the traffic which the line has to bear, from about 6 in. to 1 ft. or rather more under the
        sleepers, and the materials of the surface layers are often chosen so as to be more or less
        dustless. Its width depends on the numbers of tracks and their gauge; for a double line of
        standard gauge it is about 25 ft., a space of 6 ft. (“ six-foot way ”) being left between
        the inner rails of each pair in Great Britain (fig. 8), and a rather larger distance in
        America</p>

    <p> Sleepers, called ties or cross-ties in America, are the blocks or slabs on which the rails
        are carried. They are nearly always placed transversely, across the direction of the lines,
        the longitudinal position such as was adopted in connexion with the broad gauge on the Great
        Western in England having been abandoned except in special cases. Stone blocks were tried as
        sleepers in the early days of railways, but they proved too rigid, and besides, it was found
        difficult to keep the line true with them. Wood is the material most widely used, but steel
        is employed in some countries where timber is scarce or liable to destruction by white ants,
        though it is still regarded as too expensive in comparison with wood for general adoption.
        Steel sleepers were used experimentally on the London &amp; North-Western, but were
        abandoned owing to the shortness of their life. In Germany, where they have met with greater
        favour, there were over 26$ millions in use in 1905,<ref xml:id="r1" target="n1"
            >1</ref><note xml:id="n1" n="1"> See a full account of steel sleepers in a paper read by
            A. Haar-mann before the Verein der Deutschen Eisenhüttenleute on Dec. 8, 1907,
            translated in the Railway Gazette (London) on April 10 and 17, 1908. </note> and they
        have been tried by some American railways. Numerous forms of ferro-concrete sleepers have
        also been devised. </p>
    <p> In Great Britain, Germany and France, at least 90% of the wooden sleepers are “ treated ”
        before they are laid, to increase their resistance to decay, and the same practice is
        followed to some extent in other European countries. A great number of preservative
        processes have been devised. In that most largely used, known as “ creosoting,” dead oil of
        tar, to the amount of some 3 gallons per sleeper, is forced into the wood under pressure, or
        is sucked in by vacuum, both the timber and the oil being heated. In the United States only
        a small percentage of the ties are treated in any way beyond seasoning in the open air,
        timber, in the opinion of the railway officials, being still too cheap in nearly all parts
        of that country to justify the use of preservatives. Some railway companies, however, having
        a long mileage in timberless regions, do E&lt; treat ” their sleepers. </p>
    <p> Typical dimensions for sleepers on important British railways ire:—length 9 ft., breadth 10
        in., and depth 5 in. In America 3 ft. is the most common length, the breadth being 8 in.,
        and the depth 6 or 7 in. </p>
    <p> There are two main ways of attaching the rails to the sleepers, corresponding to two main
        types of rails—the bull-headed rail and the Vignoles or flange rail. In the first method,
        which is practically universal in Great Britain and is also employed to </p>
    <p> some extent in France and India, the rails have rounded bases and are supported by being
        wedged, with wooden keys, in cast-iron chairs which are bolted to -the sleepers. In the
        second method the rails have flat flanged bases which rest directly on the sleepers (fig.
        io). The chairs on the British system weigh about 45 or 50 lb each on important lines,
        though they may be less where the traffic is light, and are fixed to the sleepers each by
        two, three or four fastenings, either screw spikes, or round drift bolts entered in holes
        previously bored, or fang bolts or wooden trenails. Sometimes a strip of felt is interposed
        between the chair and the sleeper, and sometimes a serrated surface is prepared on the
        sleeper for the chair which is forced into its seat by hydraulic pressure. The keys which
        hold the rail in the chairs are usually of oak and are placed outside the rails; the inside
        position has also been employed, but has the disadvantage of detracting from the elasticity
        of the road since the weight of a passing train presses the rails up against a rigid mass of
        metal instead of against a slightly yielding block of wood. The rails, which for heavy main
        line traffic may weigh as much as r00 lb per yard, or eVen more, are rolled in lengths of
        from 30 to 60 ft., and sleepers are placed under them at intervals of between 2 and 3 ft.
        (centre to centre), 11 sleepers to a 30 ft. rail being a common arrangement. On the London
        &amp; North-Western railway there are 24 sleepers to each 60 ft. rail. A small space is left
        between the end of one rail and that of the next, in order to allow for expansion in hot
        weather, and at the joint the two are firmly braced together by a pair of fish-plates
        (fig.n). These are flat bars of iron or steel from r8 in. to 2 ft. long, which are lodged in
        the channels of the rail, one on each side, and secured with four bolts passing through the
        web; sometimes, to give additional stiffness, they extend down below the lower table of the
        rail and are bent round so as to clip it. Occasionally the joints thus formed are “
        supported ” on a sleeper, as was the practice in the early days of railway construction, fmt
        they are generally “ suspended ” between two sleepers, which are set rather more closely
        together than at other points in the rail. Preferably, they are so arranged that those in
        both lines of rails come opposite each other and are placed between the same pair of
        sleepers. </p>
    <p> Flat-bottomed rails are fastened to the sleepers by hookheaded spikes, the heads of which
        project over the flanges. In the United States the spikes are simply driven in with a maul,
        and the rails stand upright, little care being taken to prepare seats for them on the
        sleepers, on which they soon seat themselves. The whole arrangement is simple and cheap in
        first cost, and it lends itself admirably to fast track-laying and to repairs and changes of
        line. On the continent of Europe the practice is common of notching the sleeper so as to
        give the rail a slight cant inwards—a result obtained in England by canting the rail in the
        chairs—and metal plates or strips of felt are put under the rail, which is carefully
        fastened to the sleeper by screwed spikes (fig. 12). This method of construction is more
        expensive than the American in first cost, but it gives a more durable and stable track.
        Such metal plates, or “ tie-plates,” have come into considerable use also in the United
        States, where they are always made of rolled steel, punched with rectangular holes through
        which the spikes pass. They serve two principal </p>
    <p> purposes: they diminish the wear of the sleeper under the rail by providing a larger bearing
        surface, and they help to support the spikes and so to keep the gauge. On all the accepted
        forms there are two or more flanges at the bottom, running lengthwise of the plate and
        crosswise of the rail; these are requisite to give proper stiffness, and further, as they
        are forced into the tie by the weight of passing traffic, they help to fix the plate
        securely in place. The joints of flanged rails are similar to those employed with
        bull-headed rails. Various forms, mostly patented, have been tried in the United States, but
        the one most generally adopted consists of two symmetrical angle bars (fig. 13), varying in
        length (from 20 to 48 in.), in weight and in the number of bolts, which may be four or
        six.</p>
    <p> The substitution of steel for iron as the material for rails which' made possible the axle'
        loads and the speeds of to-day, and, by reducing the cost of maintenance, contributed
        enormously to the economic efficiency of railways, was one of the most important events in
        the histoiy of r^ways, and a scarcely less important element of progressive economy has been
        the continued improvement of the steel rail in stiffness of section and in toughness and
        hardness of material. Carbon is the important element in controlling hardness, and the
        amount present is in general higher in the United States than in Great Britain. The
        specifications for bull-headed rails issued by the British Engineering Standards Committee
        in 1904 provided for a carbon-content ranging from 0*35 to 0-50%, with a phosphorus maximum
        of 0-075%. In the United States a committee of the American Society of Civil Engineers,
        appointed to consider the question of rail manufacture in consequence of an increase in the
        number of rail-failures, issued an interim report in 1907 in which it suggested a range of
        carbon from 0-55 to 0-65% for the heaviest sections of Bessemer steel flange rails, with a
        phosphorus maximum of 0-085%; while the specifications of the American Society for Testing
        Materials, current at the same period, put the carbon limits at 0-45 to 0-55%, and the
        phosphorus limit at o-io. For rails of basic open-hearth steel, which is rapidly ousting
        Bessemer steel, the Civil Engineers’ specifications allowed from 0-65 to 0-75% of carbon
        with 0-05% of phosphorus, while the specifications of the American Railway Engineering and
        Maintenance of Way Association provided for a range of 0*75 to 0-85% of carbon, with a
        maximum of 0-03% of phosphorus. The rail-failures mentioned above also drew renewed
        attention to the importance of the thermal treatment of the steel from the time of melting
        to the last passage through the rolling mill and to the necessity of the finishing
        temperature being sufficiently low if the product is to be fine grained, homogeneous and
        tough; and to permit of this requirement being met there was a tendency to increase the
        thickness of the metal in the web and flanges of the rails. The standard specification
        adopted by the Pennsylvania railway in 1908 provided that in rails weighing 100 lb to the
        yard 41 % of the metal should be in the head, i8-6% in the web, and 40-4% in the base, while
        for 85 lb rails 42-2% was to be in the head, 17-8% in the web and 40-0% in the base. These
        rails were to be rolled in 33-ft. lengths. According to the specification for 85 lb rails
        adopted by the Canadian Pacific railway about the same time, 36-77% of the metal was to be
        in the head, 22-21 % in the web and 41-02% in the base.</p>
    <p> Points and Crossings.—To enable trains to be transferred from one pair of rails to another
        pair, as from the main line to a siding, “ points ” or “ switches ” are provided. At the
        place where the four rails come together, the two inner ones (one of the main line and the
        other of the siding), known as “ switch rails ” (δ, fig. 14), are tapered to a fine point or
        tongue, and rigidly connected together at such a distance apart that when one of the points
        is pressed against the outer or “stock”</p>
    <p> rail (a) of either the siding or the main line there is sufficient space between the other
        tongue and the other stock rail to permit the free passage of the flanges of the wheels on
        one side of the train, while the flanges on the other side find a continuous path along the
        other switch rail and thus are deflected in the desired direction. The same arrangement is
        employed at junctions where different running lines converge. The points over which a train
        travels when directed from the main to a branch line are called “ facing points ” (FP),</p>
    <p> while those which it passes when running from a branch to a main line arc “ trailing points
        ” (TP).</p>
    <p> In Great Britain the Board of Trade requires facing points to be avoided as far as possible;
        but, of course, they are a necessity at junctions where running lines diverge and at the
        crossing places which must be provided to enable trains to pass each other on single-track
        lines. At stations the points that give access to sidings are generally arranged as trailing
        points with respect to the direction of traffic on the main lines; that is, trains cannot
        pass direct into sidings, but have to stop and then run backwards into them. In shunting
        yards the points are commonly set in the required direction by means of hand levers placed
        close beside the lines, but those at junctions and those which give access from the main
        lines to sidings at wayside stations are worked by a system of rods from the signal cabin,
        or by electric or pneumatic power controlled from it and interlocked with the signals (see
        Signal: § Railway). Crossings are inevitable adjuncts of points. Where a branch diverges
        from a main line, one rail of the one must cross one rail of the other, and a V-crossing is
        formed (V). Where, as at a double-line junction, one pair of rails crosses another pair,
        “diamond” crossings (D) are formed. At both types of crossing, check rails (c) must be
        provided to guide the wheel-flanges, and if these are not accurately placed the safety of
        the trains will be endangered. At double-line junctions trains passing over the diamond
        crossings evidently block traffic going in the opposite direction to that in which they are
        travelling. To avoid the delay thus caused the branch line which would occasion the diamond
        crossing if it were taken across on the level is sometimes carried over the main line by an
        over-bridge (“ flying junction ”) or under it by an under-bridge (“ burrowing
        junction”).</p>
    <p> Railway Stations.—Railway stations are either “ terminal ” or “ intermediate.” A terminal
        station embraces (1) the passenger station; (2) the goods station; (3) the locomotive,
        carriage and waggon depots, where the engines and the carrying stock are kept, cleaned,
        examined and repaired. At many intermediate stations the same arrangements, on &amp; smaller
        scale, are made; in all of them there is at least accommodation for the passenger and the
        goods traffic. The stations for</p>
    <p> passengers and goods are generally in different and sometimes in , distant positions, the
        place selected for each being that which is most- convenient for the traffic. The passenger
        station abuts on the main line, or, at termini, forms the natural terminus, at a place as
        near as can conveniently be obtained to the centre of the population which constitutes the
        passenger traffic; and preferably its platforms should be at or near the ground level, for
        convenience of access. The goods station is approached by a siding or fork set off from the
        main line at a point short of the passenger station. In order to keep down the expense of
        shunting the empty trains and engines to and from the platforms the carriage and locomotive
        depots should be as near the passenger station as possible; but often the price of land
        renders it impracticable to locate them in the immediate vicinity and they are to be found
        at a distance of several miles. </p>
    <p> In laying out the approaches and station yard of a passenger station ample width and space
        should be provided, with well-defined means of ingress and egress to facilitate the
        circulation of vehicles and with a long setting-down pavement to enable them to discharge
        their passengers and luggage without delay. The position of the main buildings *—ticket
        offices, waiting and refreshment-rooms, parcels offices, &amp;c.—relative to the direction
        of the lines of rails may be used as a means of classifying terminal stations. They are
        placed either on the departure side parallel to the platform (“ side ” stations) or at right
        angles to the rails and platforms (“ end ” stations). Many large stations, however, are of a
        mixed type, and the offices are arranged in a fork between two or more series of platforms,
        or partly at the end and partly on one side. Where heavy suburban traffic has to be dealt
        with, the expedient is occasionally adopted of taking some of the lines round the end in a
        continuous loop, so that incoming trains can deposit their passengers at an underground
        platform and immediately proceed on their outward journey. Intermediate stations, like
        terminal ones, sheuld be convenient in situation and easy of approach, and, especially if
        they are important, should be on the ground level rather than on an embankment or in a
        cutting. The lines through them should be, if possible, straight and on the level; the
        British Board of Trade forbids them being placed on a gradient steeper than i in 260, unless
        it is unavoidable. Intermediate stations at the surface level are naturally constructed as
        side stations, and whether offices are provided on both sides or whether they are mainly
        concentrated on one will depend on local circumstances, the amount of the traffic, and the
        direction in which it preponderates. When the railway lies below the surface level the bulk
        of the offices are often placed on a bridge spanning the lines, access being given to the
        platforms by staircases or lifts, and similarly when the railway is at a high level the
        offices may be arranged under the lines. Occasionally on a double-track railway one platform
        placed between the tracks serves both of them; this “island” arrangement, as it is termed,
        has thè advantage that more tracks can be readily added without disturbance of existing
        buildings, but when it is adopted the exit from the trains is at the opposite side to that
        which is usual, and accidents have happened through passengers alighting at the usual side
        without noticing the absence of a platform. At stations on double-track railways which have
        a heavy traffic four tracks are sometimes provided, the two outside ones only having
        platforms, so that fast trains get a clear road and can pass slow ones that are standing in
        the station. In Great Britain, it may be noted, trains almost invariably keep to the left,
        whereas in most other countries right-handed running is the rule. </p>
    <p> The arrangement and appropriation of the tracks in a station materially affect the
        economical and efficient working of the traffic. There must be a sufficient provision of
        sidings, connected with the running tracks by points, for holding spare rolling stock and to
        enable carriages to be added to or taken off trains and engines to be changed with as little
        delay as possible. At terminal stations, especially at such as are used by short-distance
        trains which arrive at and start from the same platform, a third track is often laid between
        a pair of platform tracks, so that the engine of a train which has arrived at the platform
        can pass out and place itself at the other end of the train, which remains undisturbed. At
        the new Victoria station (London) of the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast railway—which is
        so long that two trains can stand end to end at the platforms—this system is extended so as
        to permit a train to start out from the inner end of a platform even though another train is
        occupying the outer end. One of the advantages of electric trains on the multiple control
        system is that they economize terminal accommodation, because they can be driven from either
        end indifferently, and therefore avoid the necessity for tracks by which engines can change
        from one end of the train to the other. </p>
    <p> The platforms on British railways have a standard elevation of 3 ft. above rail level, and
        they are not now made less than 2\ ft. in height. In other countries they are generally
        lower; in the United States they are commonly level with, or only a few inches higher than,
        the top of the rails. They may consist of earth with a retaining wall along the tracks and
        with the surface gravelled or paved with stone or asphalt, or they may be constructed
        entirely of timber, or they may be formed of stone slabs supported on longitudinal walls.
        They should he of ample dimensions to accommodate the traffic—the British Board of Trade
        requires them to be not less than 6 ft. wide at small stations and not less than 12 ft. wide
        at large ones—and they should be as free as possible from obstructions, such as pillars
        supporting the roof. At intermediate stations the roofs are often carried on brackets fixed
        to the walls of the station buildings, and project only to the edge of the platforms. At
        larger stations where both the platforms and the tracks arc covered in, there are two broad
        types of construction, with many intermediate variations: the roof may either be
        comparatively low, of the “ ridge and furrow ” pattern, borne on a number of rows of
        pillars, or it may consist of a single lofty span extending clear across the area from the
        side walls. The advantage claimed for roofs formed with one or two large spans is that they
        permit the platforms and tracks to be readily rearranged at any time as required, whereas
        this is difficult with the other type, especially since the British Board of Trade requires
        the pillars to be not less than 6 ft. away from the edges of the platforms. On the other
        hand, wide spans are more expensive both in first cost and in maintenance, and there is the
        possibility of a failure such as caused the collapse in December 1905 of the roof of Charing
        Cross (S.E.R.) station, London, which then consisted of a single span. Whatever the pattern
        adopted for the roof, a sufficient portion of it must be glazed to admit light, and it
        should be so designed that the ironwork can be easily inspected and painted and the glass
        readily cleaned. For the illumination of large stations by night electric arc lamps are
        frequently employed, but some authorities favour high-pressure incandescent gas-lighting. </p>
    <p> At busy stations separate tracks are sometimes appropriated to the use of fight engines and
        empty trains, on which they may be run between the platforms and the locomotive and carriage
        depots. A carriage depot includes sheds in which the vehicles are stored, arrangements for
        washing and cleaning them, and sidings on which they are marshalled into trains. At a
        locomotive depot the chief building is the “ running shed ” in which the engines are housed
        and cleaned. This may be rectangular in shape (“ straight ” shed), containing a series of
        parallel tracks on which the engines stand and which are reached by means of points and
        crossings diverging from a main track outside; or it may take a polygonal or circular form
        (round house or rotunda), the fines for the engines radiating from a turn-table which
        occupies the centre and can be rotated so as to serve any of the radiating lines. The second
        arrangement enables any particular engine to enter or leave without disturbing the other;
        but on the other hand an accident to the turn-table may temporarily imprison the whole of
        them. In both types pits are constructed between the rails </p>
    <p> on which the engines stand to afford easy access for the inspection and cleaning of their
        mechanism. Machine shops are usually provided to enable minor repairs to be executed; the
        tendency, both in England and America, is to increase the amount of such repairing plant at
        engine sheds, thus lengthening the intervals between the visits of the engines to the main
        repairing shops of the railway. A locomotive depot further includes stores of the various
        materials required in working the engines, coal stages at which they are loaded with coal,
        and an ample supply of water. The quality of the last is a matter of great importance; when
        it is unsuitable, the boilers will suffer, and the installation of a water-softening plant
        may save more in the expenses of boiler maintenance than it costs to operate. The water
        cranes or towers which are placed at intervals along the railway to supply the engines with
        water require similar care in regard to the quality of the water laid on to them, as also to
        the water troughs, or track tanks as they are called in America, by which engines are able
        to pick up water without stopping. These consist of shallow troughs about 18 in. wide,
        placed between the rails on perfectly level stretches of line. When water is required, a
        scoop is lowered into them from below the engine, and if the speed is sufficient the water
        is forced up it into the tender-tanks. Such troughs were first employed on the London &amp;
        North-Western railway in 1857 by John Ramsbottom, and have since been adopted on many other
        lines.</p>
    <p> Goods stations vary in size from those which consist of perhaps a single siding, to those
        which have accommodation for thousands of wagons. At a small roadside station, where the
        traffic is of a purely local character, there will be some sidings to which horses and carts
        have access for handling bulk goods like coal, gravel, manure, &amp;c., and a covered shed
        for loading and unloading packages and materials which it is undesirable to expose to the
        weather. The shed may have a single pair of rails for wagons running through it along one
        side of a raised platform, there being a roadway for carts on the other side; or if more
        accommodation is required there may be two tracks, one on each side of the platform, which
        is then approached by carts at the end. In either case the platform is fitted with a crane
        or cranes for lifting merchandise into and out of the wagons, and doors enable the shed to
        be used as a lock-up warehouse. In a large station the arrangements become much more
        complicated, the precise design being governed by the nature of the traffic that has to be
        served and by the physical configuration of the site. It is generally convenient to keep the
        inwards and the outwards traffic distinct and to deal with the two classes separately; at
        junction stations it may also be necessary to provide for the transfer of freight from one
        wagon to another, though the bulk of goods traffic is conveyed through to its destination in
        the wagons into which it was originally loaded. The increased loading space required in the
        sheds is obtained by multiplying the number and the length of lines and platforms; sometimes
        also there are short sidings, cut into the platforms at right angles to the lines, in which
        wagons are placed by the aid of wagon turn-tables, and sometimes the wagons are dealt with
        on two floors, being raised or lowered bodily from the ground level by lifts. The higher
        floors commonly form warehouses where traders may store goods which have arrived or are
        awaiting despatch. An elaborate organization is required to keep a complete check and record
        of all the goods entering and leaving the station, to ensure that they are loaded into the
        proper wagons according to their destination, that they are unloaded and sorted in such a
        way that they can be delivered to their consignees with the least possible delay, that they
        are not stolen or accidentally mislaid, &amp;c.; and accommodation must be provided for a
        large. clerical and supervisory staff to attend to these matters. British railways also
        undertake the collection and delivery of freight, in addition to transporting it, and thus
        an extensive range of vans and wagons, whether drawn by horses or mechanically propelled,
        must be provided in connexion with an important station.</p>
    <p> Shunting Yards.—It may happen that from a large station sufficient traffic may be consigned
        to certain other large stations to enable full train-loads to be made up daily, or several
        times a day, and despatched direct to their destinations. In general, however, the
        conditions are less simple. Though a busy colliery may send off its product by the
        train-load to an important town, the wagons will usually be addressed to a number of
        different consignees at different depots in different parts of the town, and therefore the
        train will have to be broken up somewhere short of its destination and its trucks
        rearranged, together with those of other trains similarly constituted, into fresh trains for
        conveyance to the various depots. Again, a station of moderate size may collect goods
        destined for a great variety of places but not in sufficient quantities to compose a full
        train-load for any of them, and then it becomes impossible, except at the cost of
        uneconomical working, to avoid despatching trains which contain wagons intended for many
        diverse destinations. For some distance these wagons will all travel over the same line, but
        sooner or later they will reach a junction-point where their ways will diverge and where
        they must be separated. At this point trains of wagons similarly destined for different
        places will be arriving from other lines, and hence the necessity will arise of collecting
        together from all the trains all the wagons which are travelling to the same place.</p>
    <p> The problem may be illustrated diagrammatically as follows (fig* 15)· A may be supposed to
        be a junction outside a large</p>
    <p> seaport where branches from docks a, b, c and d converge, and where the main line also
        divides into three, 1 [Igoing to B, C and D respectively. A train from a will contain some
        wagons for B, some for C and some for D, as will also the trains from a, b t c and d. At A
        therefore it becomes necessary to disentangle and group together all the wagons that are
        intended for B, all that are intended for C, and all that are intended for D. Even that is
        not the whole of the problem. Between A and B, A and C, and A and D, there may be a string
        of stations, p t q y r, s t &amp;c., all receiving goods from a y b, c and d, and it would
        manifestly be inconvenient and wasteful of time and trouble if the trains serving those
        intermediate stations were made up with, say, six wagons from a to p next the engine, five
        from b to p at the middle, and four from c to p near the end. Hence at A the trucks from a,
        6, c and d must not only be sorted according as they have to travel along A B, A C, or A D,
        but also must be marshalled into trains in the order of the stations along those lines.
        Conversely, trains.arriving at A from B, C and D must be broken up and remade in order to
        distribute their wagons to the different dock branches.</p>
    <p> To enable the wagons to be shunted into the desired order yards containing a large number of
        sidings are constructed at important junction points like A. Such a yard consists
        essentially of a group or groups of sidings, equal in length at least to the longest train
        run on the line, branching out from a single main track and often again converging to a
        single track at the other end; the precise design, however, varies with the amount and
        character of the WOrk that has to be done, with the configuration of the ground, and also
        with the mode of shunting adopted. The oldest and commonest method of shunting is that known
        as 11 push-and-pull,” or in America as " link-and-pin ” or 11 tail ” shunting. An engine
        coupled to a batch of wagons runs one or more of them down one siding, leaves them there,
        then returns back with the remainder clear of the points where the sidings diverge, runs one
        or more others down another siding, and so on till they are all disposed of. The same
        operation is repeated with fresh batches ofw'agons, until the sidings contain a number of
        trains, each intended, it may be supposed, for a particular town or district. In -some cases
        nothing more is required than to attach an engine and brake-van (" caboose ”) and despatch
        the train; but if, as will happen in others, a further rearrangement of</p>
    <p> the wagons is necessary to get them into station order this is effected on the same
        principle. </p>
    <p> Push-and-pull shunting is simple, but it is also slow, and therefore efforts have been made
        at busy yards where great numbers of trains are dealt with to introduce more expeditious
        methods. One of these, employed in America, is known as 11 poling.” Alongside the tracks on
        which stand the trains that are to be broken up and From which the sidings diverge
        subsidiary tracks are provided for the use of the shunting engines. These engines have a
        pole projecting horizontally in front of them, or are attached to a “ pole-car ” having such
        a pole. The method of working is for the pole to be swung out behind a number of wagons; one
        engine is then started and with its pole pushes the wagons in front of it until their speed
        is sufficient to carry them over the points, where they are diverted into any desired
        siding. It then runs back to the train to repeat the operation, but while it is doing so a
        second engine similarly equipped has poled away; a batch of wagons on the opposite side. In
        this way a train is distributed with great rapidity, especially if the points giving access
        to the different sidings are worked by power so that they can be quickly manipulated. ^ </p>
    <p> Another method, which was introduced into America from Europe about 1890, is that of the
        summit or “ hump.” The wagons are pushed by an engine at their rear up one slope of an
        artificial mound, and as they run down the other slope by gravity are switched into the
        desired siding. Sometimes a site can be found for the sorting sidings where the natural
        slope of the ground is sufficiently steep to make the wagons run down of themselves. One of
        the earliest and best known of such “ gravity ” yards is that at Edgehill, near Liverpool,
        on the London &amp; North-Western railway, which was established in 1873. Here, at the
        highest level, there are a^ number of “ upper reception lines ” converging to a single line
        which leads to a group of “ sorting sidings ” at a lower level. These in turn :onverge to a
        pair of single lines which lead to two groups of marshalling sidings, called “ gridirons ”
        from their shape, and these again converge to single lines leading to “ lower reception and
        departure lines” at the bottom of the slope. The wa^ons from the upper reeeption lines are
        sorted into trains on the sorting sidings, and then, in the gridirons, are arranged in the
        appropriate order and marshalled ready to be sent off from the departure lines. (H. M. R.) </p>
    <p> Locomotive Power </p>
    <p> The term “ power ” is used in technical sense to mean the rate at which work is done against
        a resistance, and is measured in units of energy expended per unit of time. The unit of
        power commonly used by engineers is the horse-power, and this unit corresponds to a rate of
        working of 550 foot-ib of work per second. The problems arising out of the special
        consideration of the power required to propel a railway train against the resistances
        opposing its motion, the way the power is applied to trains, the agent by means of which the
        power is exerted, are conveniently grouped together under the general heading of Locomotive
        Power. There are certain fundamental relations common to ill tractive problems, and these
        are briefly considered in §§ 1 and 2, after which the article refers particularly to steam
        locomotives, although §§4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 have a general application to all modes of
        traction. </p>
    <p> § 1. Fundamental Relations .—The resistance against which 1 train is moved along a railway
        is overcome by means of energy obtained from the combustion of fuel, or in some few cases by
        energy obtained from a waterfall. If the total resistance against which the train is
        maintained in motion with an instantaneous velocity of V feet per second is R, the rate at
        which energy is expended in moving the train is represented by the product RV, and this must
        be the rate at which energy is supplied to the train after deducting all losses due to
        transmission Erom the source of power. Thus if R is equal to 10,000 lb when the velocity is
        44 ft. per second, equivalent to 30 m. per hour, the rate of working against the resistance
        is 440,000 foot-lb per second. </p>
    <p> In whatever form energy is produced and distributed to the train it ultimately appears as
        mechanical energy applied to turn one or more axles against the resistance to their rotation
        imposed by the weight on the wheels and the motion of the train. </p>
    <p> The rate at which work is done on a particular axle is measured by the product Ta&gt;, where
        T is the torque^ or turning moment exerted on the axle by the motor or mechanism applied to
        it^ for this purpose, and w is the angular velocity of the axle in radians per second. Hence
        if all the energy supplied to the train is utilized at one axle there is the fundamental
        relation </p>
    <p> Tco = RV (1) </p>
    <p> Continuing the above arithmetical illustration, if the wheels to the axle of which the
        torque is applied are 4 ft. diameter, w = 44/2 = 22 radians per secondhand therefore T =
        440,000/22 = 20,000 lb ft. If the energy supplied is distributed between several axles the
        relation becomes </p>
    <p> Tia)i+T2W2-j-T3W3 . . . =RV (2) </p>
    <p> where Ti, T 2 , T 3f &amp;c. are the torques on the axles whose respective angular
        velocities arc a&gt;i,a&gt; 2 , o&gt;t f &amp;c. </p>
    <p> The fundamental condition governing the design of all tractive machinery is that the wheels
        belonging to the axles to which torque is applied shall roll along the rails without
        slipping, and exert a tractive force on the train. </p>
    <p> The fundamental relation between the applied torque and the tractive force F will be
        understood from fig. 16, which shows in a diagrammatic form a wheel and axle connected to
        the framework of a vehicle, in the way adopted for railway trains. The journal of the axle
        A, is carried in a bearing or axle-box B, which is free to move vertically in the wide i
        vertical slot G, formed in the frame and called generally “ the horns,'" under the control
        of the spring. </p>
    <p> The weight Wi carried by the part of the frame supported ^ by the wheel (whose diameter is
        D) is transmitted first to the pins Pi, P 2 , 1 which are fixed to the frame, and then to
        the spring links Li, L^, which are jointed at their respective ends to the spring S, the
        centre of which rests on the axle-box. </p>
    <p> Let a couple be applied to the axle tending to turn it in the direction shown^ by the arrow.
        This couple, we may assume, will be equally divided between the two wheels, so that the
        torque acting on each will be £T. Assuming the wheels to roll along the rail without
        slipping, this couple will be equivalent to the couple formed by the equal opposite and
        parallel forces, Fi acting in the direction shown, from the axle-box on to the frame, and Fi
        —¡jB, acting along the rail. The torque corresponding to this couple is Fi X $D = and hence
        follows the fundamental relation, JT = JFiD = |jAViD, or if W now represents the weight
        supported by the axle, F will be the tractive force exerted on the frame by the two
        axle-boxes to propel the vehicle, and the more convenient relation is established, T = JFD =
        i/xWD b _ .(3) </p>
    <p> If T has a greater value than this relation justifies the wheels will slip. F is called the
        11 tractive force " at the rail. The coefficient of friction /x is a variable quantity
        depending upon the state of the rails, but is usually taken to be J. This is the fundamental
        equation between the forces acting, however the torque may be applied. Multiplying through
        by o&gt; we obtain </p>
    <p> Ta&gt; = JFo&gt;D = 4 /xWwD = RV (4) </p>
    <p> This is a fundamental energy equation for any form of locomotive in which there is only one
        driving-axle. </p>
    <p> The couple T is necessarily accompanied by an equal and opposite couple acting on the frame,
        which couple endeavours to turn the frame in the &lt;mposite direction to that in which the
        axle rotates. The practical effect of this opposite couple is slightly to tilt the frame and
        thus to redistribute slightly the weights on the wheels carrying the vehicle. </p>
    <p> If there are several driving-axles in a train, the product Tw must be estimated for each
        separately; then the sum of the products will be equal to RV. In equation (4)^ there is a
        fixed relation between o&gt;, V and D given by the expression </p>
    <p>
        <a href="#bookmark0"> = 2 V/D . (5) </a>
    </p>
    <p> Here D is in feet, V in feet per second and w in radians per second. If the speed is given
        in miles per hour, S say, </p>
    <p>
        <a href="#bookmark1"> V-1*466 S (6) </a>
    </p>
    <p> The revolutions of the axle per second, n t are connected with the radians turned through
        per second by the relation </p>
    <p>
        <a href="#bookmark2"> n=oj/ </a> 27 r = 01/6*38 (7) </p>
    <p> § 2. Methods of Applying Locomotive Power .—By locomotive power is to be understood the
        provision of power to maintain the rates of working on the driving-axles of a train
        indicated by the relation (4). The most usual way of providing this power is by the
        combustion of coal in the fire-box of a boiler and the utilization of the steam produced in
        a steam-engine, both boiler and engine being carried on a frame mounted on wheels in such a
        w r ay that the crank-shaft of the steam-engine becomes the driving-axle of the train. From
        equation (3) it is clear that the wheels of the driving-axle must be heavily loaded in order
        that F may have a value sufficiently great to propel the train. The maximum weight which one
        pair of wheels are usually allowed to carry on a first-class track is from 18 to 20 tons. If
        a larger </p>
    <p> value of the tractive force is required than this provides for, namely from 4 to 5 tons, the
        driving-wheels are coupled to one or more pairs of heavily loaded wheels, forming a class of
        what are called “ coupled engines ” in contradistinction to the “ single engine ” with a
        single pair of loaded driving-wheels. Mechanical energy may be developed in bulk at a
        central station conveniently situated with regard to a coal-field or a waterfall, and after
        transformation by means of electric generators into electric energy it may be transmitted to
        the locomotive and then by means of electric motors be rctransformed into mechanical energy
        at the axles to which the motors are applied. Every axle of an electric locomotive may thus
        be subjected to a torque, and the large weight which must be put on one pair of wheels in
        order to secure sufficient adhesion when all the driving is done from one axle may be
        distributed through as many pairs of wheels as desired. In fact, there need be no specially
        differentiated locomotive at all. Motors may be applied to every axle in the train, and
        their individual torques adjusted to values suitable to the weights naturally carried by the
        several axles. Such an arrangement would be ideally perfect from the point of view of the
        permanent-way engineer, because it would then be possible to distribute the whole of the
        load uniformly between the wheels. This perfection of distribution is practically attained
        in present-day practice by the multiple control system of operating an electric train, where
        motors are applied to a selected number of axles in the train, all of them being under the
        perfect control of the driver.</p>
    <p> The fundamental difference between the two methods is that while the mechanical energy
        developed by a steam engine is in the first case applied directly to the driving-axle of the
        locomotive, in the second case it is transformed into electrical energy, transmitted over
        relatively long distances, and re transformed into mechanical energy on the driving-axles of
        the train. In the first case all the driving is done on one or at most two axles, sufficient
        tractive force being obtained by coupling these axles when necessary to others carrying
        heavy loads. In the second case every axle in the train may be made a driving-axle if
        desired, in which case the locomotive as a separate machine disappears. In the second case,
        however, there are all the losses due to transmission from the central station to the train
        to be considered, as well as the cost of the transmitting apparatus itself. Ultimately the
        question resolves itself into one of commercial practicability. For suburban traffic with a
        service at a few minutes’ interval and short distances between the stations electric
        traction has proved itself to be superior in many respects to the steam locomotive, but for
        main line traffic and long distance runs it has not yet been demonstrated that it is
        commercially feasible, though it is known to be practically possible. For the methods of
        electric traction see Traction; the remainder of the present article will be devoted to the
        steam locomotive.</p>
    <p> § 3- General Efficiency of Steam Locomotive.—One pound of good Welsh coal properly burned in
        the fire-box of a locomotive yields about 15,000 British thermal units of heat at a
        temperature high enough to enable from 50 to So % to flow across the boiler-heating surface
        to the water, the rest escaping up the chimney with the furnace gases. The steam produced in
        consequence of this heat transference from the furnace gas to the water carries heat to the
        cylinder, where 7 to 11% is transformed into mechanical energy, the remainder passing away
        up the chimney with the exhaust steam. The average value of the product of these
        percentages, namely 0;65Xo-oq=o-o6 say, may be used to investigate generally the working of
        a locomotive; the actual value could only be determined by experiment in any particular
        case. With this assumption, 0'06 is the fraction of the heat energy of the coal which is
        utilized in the engine cylinders as mechanical work; that is to say, of the 15,000 B.Th.U.
        produced by the combustion of 1 lb of coal, 15.000X0*06=900 only are available for tractive
        purposes.</p>
    <p> Coals vary much in calorific value, some producing only 12,000 B.Th.U. per lb when burnt,
        whilst 15,500 is obtained from the best Welsh coals. Let E represent the pounds of coal
        burnt per hour in the fire-box of a locomotive, and let c be the calorific value in B.Th.U.
        per lb; then the mechanical energy available in footpounds per hour isapproximatelyo*o6 X
        77S XEc, and this expressed in horse-power units gives</p>
    <p> IH.p.^o^zzSXEc^</p>
    <p> 1,980,000. *</p>
    <p> A " perfect engine M receiving and rejecting steam at the same</p>
    <p> temperatures as the actual engine of the locomotive, would develop about twice this power,
        say 1400 I.H.P. This figure represents the ideal but unattainable standard of performance.
        This question of the standard engine of comparison, and the engine efficiency is considered
        in § 15 below, and the boiler efficiency in § 11 below.</p>
    <p> The indicated horse-power developed by a cylinder may always be ascertained from an
        indicator diagram and observations of the speed. Let p be the mean pressure in pounds per
        square inch, calculated from an indicator diagram taken from a particular cylinder when the
        speed of the crank-shaft is n revolutions per second. Also let / be the length of the stroke
        in feet and let a be the area of one cylinder in square inches, then, assuming two cylinders
        of equal size, I.H.P. =2 ρΐαη/ζζο (8)</p>
    <p> The I.H.P. at any instant is equal to the total rate at which energy is required to overcome
        the tractive resistance R. The horsepower available at the driving-axle, conveniently called
        the brake horse-power, is from 20 to 30 % less than the indicated horse-power, and the
        ratio, B.H.P./I.H.P. =c, is called the mechanical efficiency of the steam engine. The
        relation between the b.h.p. and the torque on the driving-axle is</p>
    <p> 550 B.H.P. =Τω ( 9 )</p>
    <p> It is usual with steam locomotives to regard the resistance R as including the frictional
        resistances between the cylinders and the driving-axle, so that the rate at which energy is
        expended in moving the train is expressed either by the product RV, or by the value of the
        indicated horse-power, the relation between them being</p>
    <p> 550 I.H.P. = RV (10)</p>
    <p> or in terms of the torque</p>
    <p> 550 I.H.P.Xe = RVe=Tw (11)</p>
    <p> The individual factors of the product RV may have any value consistent with equation (10)
        and with certain practical conditions, so that for a given value of the I.H.P. R must
        decrease if V increases. Thus if the maximum horse-power which a locomotive can develop is
        1000, the tractive resistance R, at 60 m. per hour ( = 88 ft. per second) is R =
        (ioooX55o)/88=6250 lb. If, however, the speed is reduced to 15 m. per hour ( = 22 ft. per
        second) R increases to 25,000 lb. Thus an engine working at maximum power may be used to
        haul a relatively light load at a high speed or a heavy load at a slow speed.</p>
    <p> § 4. Analysis of Train Resistance.—Train resistance may be analysed into the following
        components:—</p>
    <p> (1) Journal friction and friction of engine machinery.</p>
    <p> (2) Wind resistance.</p>
    <p> (3) Resistance due to gradients, represented by R ff .</p>
    <p> (4) Resistance due to miscellaneous causes.</p>
    <p> (5) Resistance due to acceleration, represented by R e .</p>
    <p> (6) Resistance due to curves.</p>
    <p> The sum of all these components of resistance is at any instant equal to the resistance
        represented by R. At a uniform speed on a level straight road 3, 5 and 6 are zero. The total
        resistance is conveniently divided into two parts: (1) the resistance due to the vehicles
        hauled by the engine, represented by R,; (2) the resistance of the engine and tender
        represented by R # . In each of these two cases the resistance can of course be analysed
        into the six components set out in the above list.</p>
    <p> § 5. Vehicle Resistance and Draw-bar Pull.—The power of the engine is applied to the
        vehicles through the draw-bar, so that the draw-bar pull is a measure of the vehide
        resistance. The draw-bar pull for a given load is a function of the speed of the train, and
        numerous experiments have been made to find the relation connecting the pull w'ith the speed
        under various conditions. The usual way of experimenting is to put a dynamometer car (see
        Dynamometer) between the engine and the train. This car is equipped with apparatus by means
        of which a continuous record of the draw-bar pull is obtained on a distance base; time
        indications are also made on the diagram from which the speed at any instant can be deduced.
        The pull recorded on the diagram includes the resistances due to acceleration and to the
        gradient on which the train is moving. It is usual to subtract these resistances from the
        observed pull, so as to obtain the draw-barpull reduced to what it would be at a uniform
        speed on the level. This corrected pull is then divided by the weight of the vehicles
        hauled, in which must be included the weight of the dynamometer car, and the quotient gives
        the resistance per ton of load hauled at a certain uniform speed on a straight and level
        road. A series of experiments were made by J. A. F. Aspinall on the Lancashire &amp;
        Yorkshire railway to ascertain the resistance of trains of bogie passenger carriages of
        different lengths at^ varying speeds, and the results are recorded in a paper, " Train
        Resistance," Proc. InsL C.E. (1901), vol. 147. Aspinall’s results are expressed by the
        formula</p>
    <p> U=2*5 +50-8-1-0*0278, L</p>
    <p> where r, is the resistance in pounds per ton, S is the speed in miles per hour, and L is the
        length of the train in feet measured over the</p>
    <p> carriage bodies. .The two following expressions are given in the Bulletin of the
        International Railway Congress (vol. xii. p. 1275), by Barbier, for some experiments made on
        .the Northern railway of France with a train of 157 tons mean weight; they are valid between
        37 and 77 m. per hour:— </p>
    <p> '»= 3 - 58 +· 1 65S(1 i^ 0 S+50) for 4-wheel coaches, (13) </p>
    <p> + for bogie coaches. (14) </p>
    <p> The Baldwin Locomotive Company give the formulae </p>
    <p> ^=3-36+^p (15) </p>
    <p> and </p>
    <p> rt,= i-68+o-224S for speeds from 47 to 77 m. per hour. (16) All the above formulae refer to
        carriage stock. The resistance of goods wagons has not been so systematically investigated.
        In the paper above quoted Aspinall cites a case where the resistance of a train of empty
        wagons 1830 ft. long was 18-33 lb per ton at a speed of 26 m. per hour, and a train of full
        wagons 1045 ft. long gave only 9*12 lb per ton at a speed of 29 m. per hour. The resistance
        found from the above expressions includes the components 1, 2 and 4 of -§ 4. The resistance
        caused by the wind is very variable, and in extreme cases may double^ the resistance found
        from the formulae. A side wind causes excessive flange friction on the leeward side of the
        train, and increases the tractive resistances therefore very considerably, even though its
        velocity be relatively moderate. The curves corresponding to the above expressions are
        plotted in fig. 17, four values of L being taken for formula (12) corresponding to trains of
        5, 10, 15 and 20 bogie carriages. </p>
    <p> The resistance at starting is greater than the running resistance at moderate speeds. From
        AspinalPs experiments it appears to be about 17 lb per ton, and this value is plotted on the
        diagram. </p>
    <p> The resistance to motion round a curve has not been so systematic-all}^ studied that any
        definite rule can be formulated applicable to all classes of rolling stock and all radii of
        curves. A general result could not be obtained, even from a large number of experiments,
        because the resistance round curves depends upon so many variable factors. In some cases the
        gauge is laid a little wider than the standard, and there are varying amounts of
        superelevation of the outer rail; but the most formidable factor in the production of
        resistance is the guard-rail, which is sometimes put in with the object of guiding the wheel
        which runs on the inner rail of the curv e on the inside of the flange. </p>
    <p> § 6. Engine Resistance. —From experiments made on the North-Eastern railway (see a paper by
        W. H. Smith on “ Express Locomotive Engines,” Prac . Inst. Mech. Eng. t October 1898), it
        appeared that the engine resistance was about 35 % of the total resistance, and in^ the
        train-resistance experiments on the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire railway quoted above the
        engine resistance was also about 35 % of the total resistance, thus confirming the
        North-Eastern railway results. Barbier Qoc. cit.) gives as the formula for the engine
        resistance </p>
    <p> r·=8- 51 +3-24S(i -6iS+3o)/iooo (17) </p>
    <p> where S is the speed in miles per hour. This formula is valid between speeds of 37 and 77 m.
        per hour, and was obtained in connexion with the experiments previously quoted on the
        Northern railway of France with an engine and tender weighing about 83 tons. Barbier's
        formula is plotted in fig. 17, together with a curve expressing generally the results of
        some early experiments on the Great Western railway carried out by Sir D. Gooch. The
        extension of the Barbier curve beyond the above limits in fig. 17 gives values which must be
        regarded as only very approximate. </p>
    <p> the weight of the vehicles are respectively given, the rate at which work must be done in
        the engine cylinders in order to maintain the train in motion at a stated speed can be
        computed by the aid of the curves plotted in fig. 17. Thus let an engine and tender weighing
        80 tons haul vehicles weighing 200 tons at a uniform speed on the level of 40 m. per hour.
        As given by the Barbier curves in fig. 17, the engine resistance at 40 m. per hour is 20 lb
        per ton, and the vehicle resistance 8-5 lb per ton at the same speed. Hence Engine
        resistance, R,= 80X20 =1600 lb Vehicle resistance, 1^ = 200X8-5 —1700 ,, </p>
    <p> : Train resistance, R = 3300 ,, </p>
    <p> The speed, 40 m. per hour, is equal to 58-6 ft. per second; therefore the rate of working in
        foot-pounds per second is 3300X58-6, from which I.H.P.== (3300X58*6)/550 = 354 ; This is the
        horse-power, therefore, ^ which must be developed in the cylinders to maintain the train in
        motion at a uniform speed of 40 m. per hour on a level straight road with the values of the
        resistances assumed. </p>
    <p> § 8. Rate at which work is done against a gradient. —Gradients are measured either by
        stating the number of feet horizontally, G say, in which the vertical rise is 1 ft., or by
        the vertical rise in 100 ft. measured^ horizontally expressed as a percentage, or by the
        number of feet rising vertically in a mile. Thus a gradient of 1 in 200 is the same as a
        half per cent, grade or a rise of 26-4 ft. per mile. The difference between the horizontal
        distance and the distance measured along the rail is so small that it is negligible in all
        practical calculations. Hence if a train is travelling up the gradient at a speed of V ft.
        per second, the^ vertical rise per second is V/G ft. If Wi is the weight of the train in
        pounds, the rate of working against the gradient expressed in horse-power units is </p>
    <p> H.P.=W 1 V/5 5 oG. (18) </p>
    <p> Assuming the data of the previous section, and in addition that the train is required to
        maintain a speed of 40 m. per hour up a gradient of I in 300, the extra horse-power required
        will be H p „ 280X2240X58-6 </p>
    <p> 300X550 ~ 223 · </p>
    <p> This must be exerted in addition to the horse-power calculated in the previous ’section, so
        that the total indicated horse-power which must be developed in the cylinders is now
        354+223=577. If the train is running down a gradient this horse-power is the rate at which
        gravity is working on the train, so that with the data of the previous section, on the
        assumption that the train is running down a gradient of 1 in 300, the horse-power required
        to maintain the speed would be 354—223 = 131. </p>
    <p> § 9 —Rate at which work is done against acceleration. —If Wi is the weight of the train in
        pounds and a the acceleration in feet per second, the force required to produce the
        acceleration is </p>
    <p>
        <a href="#bookmark0"> f-Wia/g. </a> (19) </p>
    <p> And if V is the average speed during the change of velocity implied by the uniform
        acceleration a, the rate at which work is done by this force is </p>
    <p>
        <a href="#bookmark1"> /V=WiVa/g (20) </a>
    </p>
    <p> or in horse-power units </p>
    <p>
        <a href="#bookmark2"> H.P. = WiVa/ssog. (21) </a>
    </p>
    <p> Assuming the data of § 7, suppose the train to change its speed from 40 to 41 m. per hour in
        13 seconds. The average acceleration in feet per second is measured by-the fraction </p>
    <p> Change of speed in feet per sec. 60-07 — 58-6 Time occupied in the change “ 13 —0-113. </p>
    <p> Therefore the horse-power which must be developed in the cylinders to effect this change of
        speed is from (21) </p>
    <p> H p _ g8oX22 4 OXo-II3X59 </p>
    <p> 550x32 </p>
    <p> The rate of working is negative when the train is retarded; for instance, if the train had
        changed its speed from 41 to 40 m. per hour in 13 seconds, the rate at which work would have
        to be absorbed by the brake blocks would represent 237 H.P. This is lost in heat produced by
        the friction between the brake blocks and the wheels, though^ in some systems of electric
        driving some of the energy stored in the train may be returned to the central station during
        retardation. The principal condition operating in the design of locomotives intended for
        local services with frequent stops is the degree of acceleration required, the aim of the
        designer being to produce an engine which shall be able to bring the train to its journey
        speed in the shortest time possible. For example, suppose it is required to start a train
        weighing 200 tons from rest and bring it to a speed of 30 m. per hour in 30 seconds. The
        weight of the engine may be assumed in advance to be 80 tons. The acceleration, a, which may
        be supposed uniform, is 1*465. The average velocity is 15 m. per hour, which is equal to 22
        ft. per second; therefore the tractive force required is, from (19), </p>
    <p> (280 X2240X1 *465)/32= 28,720 lb, and the corresponding horse-power which must be developed
        in the cylinders is, from (2o),/V/550, and this is with/and V equal to the above values,
        1149. To obtain the tractive force the weight on the coupled wheels must be about five times
        this amount—that is. </p>
    <p> 64 tons; and to obtain the horse-power the boiler will be one of the largest that can be
        built to the construction gauge. After acceleration to the journey speed of 30 m. per hour
        the horse-power required is reduced to about one-third of that required for acceleration
        alone.</p>

        train in feet per second. In this expression it is assumed that the acceleration is uniform,
        and this assumption is sufficiently accurate for any practical purpose to which the above
        formula would be applied in the ordinary working of a locomotive. If a is variable, then the
        formula must be applied in a series of steps, each step corresponding to a time interval
        over which the acceleration may be assumed uniform.</p>

    <p> total draw-bar pull=\V,r ff (24)</p>
    <p> This expression may be used to find r v when the total draw-bar pull is observed as well as
        the speed, the changes of speed and the gradient. The speed held to correspond with the
        resistance must be the mean speed during the change of speed. The best way of deducing r* is
        to select portions of the dynamometer record where the speed is constant. Then a disappears
        from all the above expressions. These expressions indicate what frequent changes in the
        power are required as the train pursues its journey up and down gradients, against wind
        resistance, journal friction and perhaps the resistance of a badly laid track; and show how
        both the potential energy and kinetic energy of the train are continually changing: the
        first from a change in vertical position due to the gradients, the second from changes in
        speed. These considerations also indicate what a difficult matter it is to find the exact
        rate of working against thcrcsistances, because of the difficulty of securing conditions
        which eliminate the effect both of the gradient and of acceleration.</p>
    <p> § ii. The Boiler.—Maximum Power.—The maximum power which can be developed by a locomotive
        depends upon the maximum rate of fuel combustion which can be maintained per square foot of
        grate. This maximum rate depends upon the kind of coal used, whether small, friable,
        bituminous or hard, upon the thickness of the fire, and upon the correct design and setting
        of the blast-pipe. A limit is reached to the rate of combustion when the draught becomes
        strong enough to carry heavy lighted sparks through the tubes and chimney. This, besides
        reducing the efficiency of the furnace, introduces the danger of fire to crops and buildings
        near the line. The maximum rate of combustion may be as much as 150 lb of coal per square
        foot of grate per hour, and in exceptional cases even a greater rate than this has been
        maintained. It is not economical to force the boiler to work at too high a rate, because it
        has been practically demonstrated that the boiler efficiency decreases after a certain
        point, as the rate of combustion increases. A few experimental results are set forth in
        Table XX., from which it will be seen that with a relatively low rate of combustion, a rate
        which denotes very light service, namely 28 lb of coal per square foot of grate per hour,
        the efficiency of the boiler is 82%, which is as good a result as can be obtained with the
        best class of stationary boiler or marine boiler even when using economizers.</p>
    <p> The first group consists of experiments selected from the records of a large number made on
        the boiler of the locomotive belonging to the Purdue University, Indiana, U.S.A.</p>
    <p> The second group consists of experiments made on a boiler belonging to the Great Eastern
        Railway Company. The first one of the group was made on the boiler fixed in the locomotive
        yard at Stratford, and the two remaining experiments of the group were made while the engine
        was working a train between London and March.</p>
    <p> The third group consists of experiments selected from the records of a series of trials made
        on the London &amp; South-Western railway with an express locomotive.</p>
    <p> § 12. Draught.—One pound of coal requires about 20 lb of air for its proper combustion in
        the fire-box of a locomotive, though this quantity of air diminishes as the rate of
        combustion increases.</p>
    <p> For instance, an engine having a grate area of. 30 sq. ft. and burning 100 lb of coal per
        square foot of grate per hour would</p>

    <p> require that 60,000 lb of air should be drawn through the furnace per hour in order to burn
        the coal. This large quantity of air is forced through the furnace by means of the
        difference of pressure established between the external atmospheric pressure in the ash-pan
        and the pressure in the smoke-box.</p>
    <p> The exhaust steam passing from the engine through the blast-pipe and the chimney produces a
        diminution of pressure, or</p>
    <p> partial vacuum, in the smoke-box roughly proportional to the weight of steam discharged per
        unit of time. The difference of pressure between the outside air and the smoke-box gases may
        be measured by the difference of the water levels in the limbs of a U tube, one limb being
        in communication with the smoke-box, the other with the atmosphere. The difference of levels
        varies from i to as much as io in. in extreme cases. The draught corresponding to the
        smallest rate of combustion shown in Table XX. in Professor Goss’s experiments, was 1-72 in.
        of water, and for the highest rate, namely 181, 7-48 in. of water. To get the best effect
        the area of the blast-nozzle must be properly proportioned to the size of the cylinders and
        be properly set with regard to the base of the chimney. The best proportions are found by
        trial in all cases. </p>
    <p> Figs. 18 and 19 show two smoke-boxes typical of English practice. Fig. 18 is the smoke-box
        of the 6 ft. 6 in. six-coupled express passenger engines designed by G. Whale for the London
        &amp; North-Western Railway Company in 1904, and fig. 19 shows the box of the four-couplecf
        express passenger engine designed by J. Holden for the </p>
    <p> Great Eastern Railway Company. In the case of the London &amp; North-Western engine (fig.
        18), the blast-pipe orifice B is placed at about the centre of the boiler barrel, and the
        exhaust steam is discharged straight into the trumpet-shaped end of the chimney, which is
        continued down inside the smoke-box. In fig. 19 the blast orifice B is set much lower, and
        the steam is discharged through a frustum of a cone set in the upper part of the smoke-box
        into the short chimney. Fig. 20 shows the standard proportions recommended by the committee
        of the Railway Master Mechanics' Association on Exhaust Pipes and Steam Passages ( Proc.Amer
        . Railway Master Mechanics* Assoc., 1906). According to the Report, for the best results
        both H and n should be made as great as practicable, and then d — o-2iD+o-i6 h f b = 2d or
        o-5D, P=o*32D, p=o-22D, L—o-6D or o*^D, but not of intermediate values. This last relation
        is, however, not well established. For much detailed information regarding American
        smoke-box practice, reference may be made to Locomotive Sparks , by Professor W. F. M. Goss
        (London, 1902). </p>
    <p> The arrangements for arresting sparks in American practice and on the continent of Europe
        are somewhat elaborate. In </p>
    <p> English practice where a spark-arrester is put in it usually takes the form of a
        wire-netting dividing the smoke-box horizontally into two parts at a level just above the
        top row of tubes, or arranged to form a continuous connexion between the blast-pipe and the
        chimney. </p>
    <p> Fig. 19 illustrates an arrangement designed by J. Holden. The heavy sparks are projected
        from the tubes in straight lines and are caught by the louvres L, L, L, and by them
        deflected downwards to the bottom of the smoke-box, where they collect in a heap in the
        space D round a tube which is essentially an ejector. At every blast a small quantity of
        steam is caught by the orifice O and led to the ejectors, one on each side, with the result
        that the ashes are blown out into the receptacles on each side of the engine, one of which
        is shown at E. The louvres /, l, l are placed to shield the central region occupied by the
        blast-pipe. </p>
    <p> As the indicated horse-power of the engine increases, the weight of steam discharged
        increases, and the smoke-box vacuum is increased, thereby causing more air to flow through
        the furnace and increasing the rate of combustion. Thus the demand for more steam is
        automatically responded to by the boiler. It is this close automatic interdependence of
        engine and boiler which makes the locomotive so extraordinarily well suited for the purpose
        of locomotive traction. </p>
    <p> § 13. The Steam Engine. —The steam engine of a locomotive has the general characteristics of
        a double-acting non-condensing engine (see Steam Engine). Distribution of steam is effected
        by a slide valve, sometimes fitted with a balancing device, and sometimes formed into a
        piston valve. All types of valves are with few exceptions operated by a link motion,
        generally of the Stephenson type, occasionally of the Allan type or the Gooch type, or with
        some form of radial gear as the Joy gear or the Walschaert gear, though the latter gear has
        characteristics which ally it with the link motions. The Stephenson link motion is used
        almost universally in England and America, but it has gradually been displaced by the
        Walschaert gear on the continent of Europe, and to some extent in England by the Joy gear.
        The general characteristics of the distribution effected by these gears are similar.' Each
        of them, besides being a reversing gear, is an expansion gear both in forward and backward
        running. The lead is variable in the Stephenson link motion, whilst in the Walschaert and
        the Joy gears it is constant. Illustrations of these gears are given in the article Steam
        Engine, and the complete distribution of steam for both forward and backward running is
        worked out for a typical example of each of them in Valves and Valve Gear Mechanisms by W.
        E. Dalby (London, 1906). </p>
    <p> ’ r § 14. Cylinder Dimensions. — Adhesion.—Tractive Force. —A locomotive must be designed to
        fulfil two conditions. First, it must be able to exert a tractive force sufficient to start
        the train under the worst conditions possible on the railway over which it is to operate—for
        instance, when the train is stopped by signal on a rising gradient where the track is curved
        and fitted with a guard-rail. Secondly, it must be able to maintain the train at a given
        speed against the total resistances of the level or up a gradient of given inclination.
        These conditions are to a certain extent mutually antagonistic, since an engine designed to
        satisfy either condition independently of the other would be a different engine from that
        designed to make the best compromise between them. </p>
    <p> Equation (3), § 1 expresses the fundamental condition which must be satisfied when a
        locomotive is starting a train. The torque exerted on the driving-axle by the steam engine
        just at starting may be that due to the full boiler pressure acting in the cylinders, but
        usually the weight on the coupled wheels is hardly sufficient to enable advantage to be
        taken of the full boiler pressure, and it has to be throttled down by the regulator to
        prevent slipping. Sand, driven between the wheel and the rail by a steam jet, used just at
        starting, increases the adhesion beyond the normal value and enables a larger pressure to be
        exerted on the piston than would otherwise be possible. When the train is started and is
        moving slowly, the torque acting on the driving-axle may be estimated as that due to about
        85% of the full boiler pressure acting in the cylinders. The torque </p>
    <p> due to the two cylinders is variable to a greater or less extent, depending upon the degree
        of expansion in the cylinders and the speed. The form of the torque curve, or crank effort
        curve, as it is sometimes called, is discussed in the article Steam Engine, and the torque
        curve corresponding to actual indicator diagrams taken from an express passenger engine
        travelling at a speed of 65 m. per hoar is given in The Balancing of Engines by W. E. Dalby
        (London, 1906).</p>
    <p> The plotting of the torque curve is laborious, but the average torque acting, which is all
        that is required for the purposes of this article, can be found quite simply, thus:—Let pbe
        the mean effective pressure acting in one cylinder, a, the area of the cylinder, and /, the
        stroke. Then the work done during one revolution of the^ crank is 2pla per cylinder.
        Assuming that the mean pressure in the other cylinder is also p % the total work done per
        revolution is 4pla. If T is the mean torque, the work done on the crank-axle per revolution
        is 2xT. Hence assuming the mechanical efficiency of the</p>
    <p> engine to be«, and substituting^? 2 for the area a,</p>
    <p> 2irT =^plae~plnd 1 € t </p>
    <p> so that</p>
    <p> T-i pd?U.</p>
    <p> But from § 1, T «■ JDF;</p>
    <p> therefore e F ^pdtU/D e (25)</p>
    <p> F in this expression is twice the average magnitude of the equal and opposite forces
        constituting the couple for one driving-wheel illustrated in fig. 16, one force of which
        acts to propel the train whilst the other is the value of the tangential frictional
        resistance between the wheel and the rail. This force F must not exceed the value /x\V or
        slipping will take place. Hence, if p is the maximum value of the mean effective pressure
        corresponding to about 85% of the boiler pressure,</p>
    <p> m \V = ^/«/D e (26)</p>
    <p> is an expression giving a relation between the total weight on the coupled wheels, their
        diameters and the size of the cylinder. The magnitude of F when p and « are put each equal
        to unity, is usually called the^ tractive force of the locomotive per pound of mean
        effective pressure in the^ cylinders. If p is the mean pressure at any speed the total
        tractive force which the engine is exerting is given by equation (25) above. The value of t
        is variable, but is between •7 and ·8, and for approximate calculations may be taken equal
        to unity. In the following examples the value will be assumed unity.</p>
    <p> These relations maybe illustrated by an example. Let an engine have two cylinders each 19
        in. diameter and 26 in. stroke. Let the boiler pressure be 175 Id per square inch. Taking
        85% of this, the maximum mean effective pressure would be 149 lb per square inch. Further,
        let the diameter of the driving-wheels be 6 ft. 3 in. Then the tractive force is, from
        (25),</p>
    <p> (i49Xi9 , X2-i66)/6*25 = i8,6oolb-8-3 tons.</p>
    <p> Assuming that the frictional resistance at the rails is given by J the weight on the wheels,
        the total weight on the driving-wheels necessary to secure sufficient adhesion to prevent
        slipping must be at least 8·3Χ5=^ϊ·5 tons. This would be distributed between three coupled
        axles giving an average of 1*38 tons per axle, though the distribution might not in practice
        be uniform, a larger proportion of the weight falling on the driving-axle. If the starting
        resistance of the whole train be estimated at 16 lb per ton, this engine would be able to
        start 1*163 tons on the level, or about 400 tons on a gradient of i in 75, both these
        figures including the weight of the engine and tender, which would be about 100 tons.</p>
    <p> The engine can only exert this large tractive force so long as the mean pressure is
        maintained at 149 lb per square inch. This high mean pressure cannot be maintained for long,
        because as the speed increases the demand for steam per unit of time increases, so that
        cut-off must take place earlier and earlier in the stroke, the limiting steady speed being
        attained when the rate at which steam is supplied to the cylinders is adjusted by the
        cut-off to be equal to the maximum rate at which the boiler can produce steam, which depends
        upon the maximum rate at which coal can be burnt per square foot of grate. If C is the
        number of pounds of coa^ burnt per square foot of grate per hour, the calorific value of
        which is c B.Th.U. per pound, the maximum indicated horse-power is given by the
        expression</p>
    <p> I.H.P. maximum- Cc ^ X 77^Xi?,</p>
    <p> Ι98ΟΟΟΟ</p>
    <p> where A is the area of the grate in square feet, and η is the combined efficiency of the
        engine and boiler. With the data of the previous example, and assuming in addition that the
        grate area is 24 sq. ft., that the rate of combustion is 150 lb of coal per square foot of
        grate per hour, that the calorific value is 14000, and finally that 17=0-06, the maximum
        indicated horse-power which the engine might be expected to develop would be
        0-06X150X14000X24X778/1980000 = 1190, corresponding to a mean effective pressure in the
        cylinders of 59*5 lb per square inch.</p>
    <p> Assuming that the train is required to run at a speed of 60 m. per hour, that is 88 ft. per
        second, the total resistance R, which the engine can overcome at this speed, is by equation
        (10)</p>
