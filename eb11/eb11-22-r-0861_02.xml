In 1814 he acted at the Josefstadter Theater, and in 1817 at the Leopoldstadter Theater. In 1823 he produced his first play, Dcr Barolnctermacher auf der Zauberinscl, which was followed by Der Diamant des Geisterkonigs (1824) and the still popular Bauer als Milliondr. The last-mentioned play, which appeared in 1S26, Der Alpenkonig ttnd der Menschenfeind (1828) and Der Verschwender (1833) are Raimund's masterpieces. He committed suicide on the 5th of September 1836, owing to the fear that he had been bitten by a mad dog. Raimund was a master of the Viennese Posse or farce; his rich humour is seen to best advantage in his realistic portraits of his fellow-citizens.</p><p> Raimund’s Samtliche Werke (with biography by J. N. Vogl) appeared in 4 vols. (1837); they have been also edited by K. Glossy and A. Sauer (4 vols., 1881; 2nd ed., 1891), and a selection by E. Castle (1903). See E. Schmidt in Charakteristiken, vol. i. (1886); A. Farinelli, Grillparzer und Raimund (1897); L. A. Frankl, Zur Biographie F. Raimunds (1884); and especially A. Sauer’s article in the Allgem.
