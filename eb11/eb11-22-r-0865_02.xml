It is spoken in Rajputana and the adjoining parts of central India, and has several dialects the principal of which are Jaipur!, Marwap, Mewat! and Malvi. Harau(!, an important variety of Jaipur!, is spoken in the states of Kota and Bundi. Carey, the well-known Seram-pur missionary, paid great attention to Rajasthani in the early part of the 19th century, translating the New Testament into no fewer than six dialects, viz. Haraup, Ujain! (i.e. Malvl), Udaipur! (a form of Marwap), Marwap proper, Jaipur! proper and BikAngri (another form of Marwap). In 1901 the total number of speakers of Rajasthan! was 10,917,712. (G.
