From the sense of orderly arrangement “ rank ” is applied to grades or classes in a social or other organization, and particularly to a high grade, as in such expressions as a “ person of rank.” This word must be distinguished from the adjective “ rank,” over-luxuriant, coarse, strong, generally connected with the Low Ger. rank , thin, tall (cf. Du. rank , upright). The O.E. nwc, warrior, i.e. full-grown man, may be also connected with the word; Skeat refers also to “rack,” to pull out straight. </p></div>
