The origin of O.Fr. rascaille, modern racaille  t  from which the word came into English, is uncertain. The word was early used, in hunting, for the weaker or poorer male deer of a herd; the word has been connected with O.Fr. rascler, mod. racier, to scrape, rake, in the sense of the off-scourings of the herd.</p></div>
