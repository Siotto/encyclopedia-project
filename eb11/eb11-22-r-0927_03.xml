He was entered at the [Middle Temple, but devoted his attention mainly to literature. Among his pieces are Mamamouchi, or The Citizen turned Gentleman (Dorset Garden, 1671, pr. 1675); The Careless Lovers (Dorset Garden, 1673, pr. 1673); a comedy</p><p> of intrigue; Scaramouch a Philosopher , Harlequin a Schoolboy , Bravo a Merchant and Magician (Theatre Royal, 1677); English Lawyer (Theatre Royal, 1678), an adaptation of George Ruggle's Latin play of Ignoramus , presented before James I. at Cambridge in March 1615; The London Cuckold (Dorset Garden, 1683), which became a stock p  :  ece, but was struck out of the repertory by Garrick in 1751; and The Italian Husband (Lincoln's Inn Fields, 1697). He wrote in all twelve plays, in which he adapted freely from Molière and others, confessing on one occasion that he “ but winnowed Shakespeare's corn.” He ventured to decry the heroic drama, and Dryden retaliated by satirizing his Mamamouchi , a foolish adaptation from Molière’s Bourgeois Gentilhomme and Monsieur de Pourceaugnac  t  in the prologue to the Assignation (Dryden, Works , ed. Scott, iv. 345 seq.). </p></div>
