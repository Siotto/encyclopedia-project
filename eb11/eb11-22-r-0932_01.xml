Five classes of rayahs existed under Turkish rule,—(i) the Greek, or Roum milled; (2) the Armenian, or Emeni milled; (3) the Catholic Armenians—eremeni gatoliki milled; (4) the Latin Christians, or Roum gatoliki milled; and (5) the'Jews, or ichondi milled. The name rayah is most commonly used of the peasants, but it does not apply only to the agricultural populations. It depended on status, fixed by religious faith.</p></div>
