Fr. arere , mod. arrière , Med. Lat. ad retro , to the back, backward. From this word must be distinguished the verb “ to rear,” used in two main senses: of a horse, to stand up on its hind legs, and to raise up or lift, of the construction of a building or of the breeding and bringing to maturity of domestic or other animals, often used also of young children. The O.E. r&lt;rran , of which it is the modem representative, is a doublet of the Scandinavian rets a , which has given English “ raise,” both being causative verb forms of “ rise.” </p></div>
