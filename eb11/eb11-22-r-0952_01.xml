The process is supposed to be the gradual elimination of elements in which the percepts disagree, and the emphasizing of those in which they agree. Thus the final residuum is a unity in difference. Recepts are, in fact, “ spontaneous associations, formed unintentionally as what may be termed unperceived abstractions,” i.e . what are generally known as “ generic images.” </p></div>
