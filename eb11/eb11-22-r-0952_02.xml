The word is also applied to an indentation in a line, especially of a small alcove sunk in the wall of a room. A particular use is the historical one for the acts and decrees of the Imperial Diet, the recessus Imperii , and also for those of the Hanseatic League. According to Du Cange (s.t&gt;. Recessus) the reason for the use of this word was that these decrees, &amp;c.â€˜ .{codex deliberationum ), were written out antequam a conventibus recedant proceres congregati . </p></div>
