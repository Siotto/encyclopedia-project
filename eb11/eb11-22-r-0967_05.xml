The ordinary " robin ” of North America is a thrush, Turdus migratorius (see Fieldfare), and one of the bluebirds of the same continent, Siolia sialis, is in ordinary speech the blue "robin”; the Australian and Pacific “robins” of the genus Pctrocca arc of doubtful affinity and have not all even the red breast; the Cape “ robin " is Cossophya caffra, the Indian “ robin ” Thamnobia and the New Zealand “ robin ” Miro.  </note>  or Robin, perhaps the favourite among English birds because of its pleasing colour, its sagacity and fearlessness of man, and its cheerful song, even in winter. In July and August the hedgerows of the southern counties of England are beset with redbreasts, not in flocks, but each individual keeping its own distance from the next<ref xml:id="r3" target="n3">3</ref><note xml:id="n3" n="3">1  It is a very old saying that Unum arbustutn non alii duos eritha-cos—One bush does not harbour two redbreasts.</note>  —all, however, on their way to cross the Channel. On the European continent the migration is still more marked, and the redbreast on its autumnal and vernal passages is the object of bird-catchers, since its value as a delicacy has long been recognized. Even those redbreasts which stay in Britain during the winter are subject to a migratory movement. The first sharp frost makes them change their habitation, and a heavy fall of snow drives them towards the homesteads for food. The redbreast exhibits a curious uncertainty of temperament in regard to its nesting habits. At times it wifi place the utmost confidence in man, and at times show the greatest jealousy. The nest is usually built of riioss and dead leaves, with a moderate lining of hair. In this arc laid from five to seven white eggs, sprinkled or blotched with light red.</p><p> Besides the British Islands, the redbreast (Motaoilla rubecula of Linnaeus and the Erithaais rubecula of modem authors) is generally dispersed over the continent of Europe, and is in winter found in the oases of the Sahara. Its eastern limits are not well determined. In northern Persia it is replaced by a nearly allied form, Erithacus hyreanus, distinguishable by its</p><p> more ruddy hues, while in northern China and Japan another species, E. akahige , is found of which the sexes differ somewhat in plumage—the cock having a blackish band below his red breast and greyish-black flanks, while the hen closely resembles the familiar British species—but both cock and hen have the tail of chestnut-red. The genus Erithacus , as well as that containing the other birds to which the name “ robin ” has been applied, with the doubtful exception of Petroeca , belong to the sub-family Turdinae.of the thrushes (?.?.). </p></div>
