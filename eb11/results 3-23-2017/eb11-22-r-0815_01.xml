<p><label> RAFTER, </label>
a beam in a sloping roof to which is attached the framework for the slating, tiling or other external covering (see Roofs). The O.Eng. raefter is cognate with Icel. raſtr, Dan. and Swed. rafte or raft, a beam, which, in the special sense of a floating collection of timbers, gives the English “ raft.” The ultimate base of these words is the root ro/-, to cover, seen in Gr. 6po&lt;£os, roof.</p>
