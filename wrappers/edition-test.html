   <p><strong>RABÂN</strong> (ראב״ן)—i.e., Rabbenu Eli'ezer B. Nathan of Mainz—was one of the most famous Halakliic teachers of the 12th century. He lived at Mainz and corresponded with Basin’s son-in-law, Rabbenu Meir b. Shemuel, and his three distinguished sons, Rashbam (q.v.), Ribam (R. Yishak b. Meir, who died young and left seven orphans), and Rabbenu Tham (R. Ya'akob). His great Halakhic work, צפנת פענח, or אבן העזר, is commonly called by the combinat ion of the author’s initials which heads this article, the Book of Rfibân, and was printed at Prague in 1610 fol.3 Other Halakhic literature by him is to be found in Kol Bo, § 123 (without place or date, but probably Naples, towards the end of the 15th century), and its reprints. More lies in MS. in libraries ; thus the Ehm Haro shah, of which no other copy is known, is preserved in the Cambridge University Library (Add., 498). R. Eli'ezer was also a fine liturgical poet, vying both in senti-ment and elegance with the poets of the Sepharadic school, as appears, for example, from the Ophan and other pieces designed for a Sabbath when there is a circumcision. Rabbenu Eli'ezer died in the 12th century. The date 5007 ( = 1247) which appears in the formulas of a bill of divorcement and a deed of manumission of a slave is most assuredly due to a scribe of the 13th century, who in transcribing Rabân’s book conformed the date to his own time—a practice often to be met with. Dr A. Jellinek of Vienna has published a History of the First Crusade (1קונטרס מרות תתנ״, Leipsic, 1854, 8vo)—a little book interesting in more than one way—which bears the name of Ràbàn. It cannot, however, be by the subject of this article, as one can see by comparing with his genuine work the questionable poetic stuff which forms part of the Konteres. The author is no doubt Râbân of Cologne. Nor does the commentary on אל אלהיט (for Pentecost eve) under the title of מאמר היטכל, which has been often printed, and of which the Cambridge Library has an old MS. (Add., 493, 1), The Hellenistic Rabboni (pa/?/30wa, John xx. 16) is the Aramaic ribboni used by a slave of his master, a son of his father, awife of her husband, a worshipper of his God. (Com-pare the similar variation of the vowel in pisho = 7rdo־xa.) Rabbenu signifies “our teacher” par excellence, and means in Palestine R. Yehudah Hannasi, and in Baby-Ionia Rab (i.e., Abba Arekha). Rabbah (רבה), also Rubbo and Rubboli, a title placed in the Palestinian Talmud and Midrashim after the names of certain teachers (T. Y., Berakhoth, i. 1; Kilayim, ix. 3, and elsewhere), corresponds to the Hebrew הגדול in the same connexion in the Babylonian Talmud (Berakhoth, 6a, and elsewhere), and does not, as has hitherto been supposed, mean “the great” but simply “the elder.” Thus many questionable Talmudic magnitudes disappear.

   <p><strong>Rabbah (רבה)</strong>, also Rubbo and Rubboli, a title placed in the Palestinian Talmud
      and Midrashim after the names of certain teachers (T. Y., Berakhoth, i. 1; Kilayim, ix. 3, and
      elsewhere), corresponds to the Hebrew הגדול in the same connexion in the Babylonian Talmud
      (Berakhoth, 6a, and elsewhere), and does not, as has hitherto been supposed, mean “the great”
      but simply “the elder.” Thus many questionable Talmudic magnitudes disappear. (S. M. S.-S.)
      RABA (Rob5)—i.e., Rab Aba b. Yoseph b. Hama (Hom5)—was, like his teacher Rabbah and his
      fellow-pupil Abayye, a scion of the house of Eli, on whom rested the double curse of poverty
      and that none of them should reach old age (1 Sam. ii. 31-36). According to T. B., Rosk
      Hasshanah, 18a,1 he sought to remove this curse, if not by sacrifices and offering then by the
      study of the Law, Avhile Abayye also practised works of charity. Raba, was rabbi and judge of
      the congregation and head of the school (metkibtd) of Mahuza. He lived in the middle of the
      4th Christian century, and became on the death of his fellow-pupil Abayye head of the famous
      academy of Pum-baditha, which was only closed in 1040. He was noted, like his predecessor, for
      his genius; and the discussions between them (and similar ones of others) are known in the
      Babylonian Talmud as the Havayoth de-Abayye ve-Rdbd (aSukkah, 28a). Raba was also noted for
      the liberality of his religious decisions (T. B., Berakhoth, 22b ; Pesahim, 30a, and
      elsewhere). Being a man of considerable wealth, he showed, in accordance with Scriptural truth
      (Prov. xviii. 23), his independence in every way. Thus he hesi-tated not to include the
      exquisites of the congregation of Mahuza, who were noted for their luxurious style of living,
      among the candidates for Gehenna, whose faces would one day become as dark as the sides and
      the bottom of a sauce-pan (T. B., Rash Rasshanah, 17a), whilst he most ungal-lantly applied to
      their idle wives the passage of Amos iv. 1 (T. B., Shabbath, 32b). Raba was in fact the
      Abraham a Sancta Clara of his day, minus the cloister life of the latter. He was married to
      one of the beautiful, accomplished, and amiable daughters of his teacher, R. Hisda, whom he so
      dearly loved that he was ready to forgive Bar Hadya (an interpreter of dreams who had much
      vexed him by his adverse interpretations) everything except the interpreta-tion of a dream
      foreboding her death. Raba, relying on Gen. xli. 12, 13, believed that the fulfilment of
      dreams within certain limits was influenced by the interpretation given to them (T. B.,
      Berakhoth, 55b). (s. M. s.-s.)l</p>
