   <p><h3>R</h3>THE twentieth letter in the e Phoenician alphabet, the nineteenth in the
      numerical Greek, the seventeenth in the ordinary Greek and the Latin and (owing to the
      addition of J) the eighteenth in the English. Its earliest form in the Phoenician alphabet
      when written from right to left was A&gt; thus resembling the symbol for D with one side of
      the triangle prolonged. In Aramaic and other Semitic scripts which were modified by opening
      the heads of the letters, the symbol in time became very much changed. Greek, however,
      maintained the original form with slight variations from place to place. Not infrequently in
      the Greek alphabets of Asia Minor and occasionally also in the West, R was written as D, thus
      introducing a confusion with D (q.v.). Elsewhere a short tail was added, as occasionally in
      the island of-Melos, in Attica and in western Greece, but nowhere does this seem to have been
      universal. The earliest Latin forms are exactly like the Greek. Thus in the very early
      inscriptions found in the Forum in 1899 R appears as ^ (from right to left), p and D (from
      left to right). Later the forms /? and R come in; sometimes the back is not quite connected in
      the middle to the upright, when the form P is produced. The name of the Semitic symbol is
      Resh; why it was called by the Greeks Rho is not clear. The h which accompanies r in the
      trans- literation of Greek p, indicates that it was breathed, not voiced, in pronunciation. No
      consonant varies more in pronunciation than r. According to Brockclmann, the original Semitic
      r was probably a trilled r, i.e. an r produced by allowing the tip of the tongue to vibrate
      behind the teeth while the upper surface of the tongue is pressed against the sockets of the
      teeth. The ordinary English r is also produced against the sockets of the teeth, but without
      trilling; another r, also untrilled, which is found in various parts of the south of England,
      is produced by turning up the tip of the tongue behind the sockets of the teeth till the
      tongue acquires something of a spoon shape. This, which is also common in the languages of
      modern India, is called the cerebral or cacuminal r, the former term, which has no meaning in
      this connexion, being only a bad translation of a Sanscrit term. The common German r is
      produced by vibrations of the uvula at the end of the soft palate, and hence is called the
      uvular r. There are also many other varieties of this sound. In many languages r is able to
      form syllables by itself, in the same way that /, m, n may do, as in the English brittle
      (britl), written (ritn). In Europe r with this value is most conspicuous in Slavonic languages
      like Bohemian (Czech) and Croatian; in English r in this function is replaced by a genuine
      vowel in words like mother (motto). This syllabic r is first recorded for Sanscrit, where it
      is common, but is replaced in the languages descended from Sanscrit by r and a vowel or by a
      vowel only, according to the position in which it occurs. Most philologists arc of opinion
      that syllabic r existed also in the mother-tongue of the Indo-European languages. (P. Gi.)</p>

            
   <p><h3>RAABE, HEDWIG</h3> (1844-1905), German actress, was born in Magdeburg on the 3rd of
      December 1844, and at the age of fourteen was playing in the company of the Thalia theatre,
      Hamburg. In 1864 she joined the German Court theatre at St Petersburg, touring about Germany
      in the summer with such success that in 1868 she relinquished her Russian engage- ment to
      devote herself to starring. In 1871 she married Albert Niemann (b. 1831), the operatic tenor.
      She excelled in classical ro1es like Marianne in Goetheâ€™s Geschwister and Franziska in Minna
      von Barnhelm. It was she who first played Ibsen in Berlin. She died on the 21st of April
      1905.</p>
