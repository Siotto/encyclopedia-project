   <p><h3>R or r</h3>, a liquid conſonant, being the 17th letter of R, our alphabet. Its found is formed by a guttural extruſion of the breath vibrated through the mouth, with a fort of quivering motion of the tongue drawn from the teeth, and canulated with the tip a little elevated towards the palate. In Greek words it is frequently aſpirated with an h after it, as in rhapſody, rhetoric, &amp;c. otherwiſe it is always followed by a vowel at the beginning of words and ſyllables.</p>
   <p>In the notes of the ancients, R. or RO. ſigniſies Roma ; R. C. Romana civitas ; R. G. C. rei gerenda cauf a ; R. F. E. D. recte factum et dictum ; R. G. F. regis filius ; R. P. res publica, or Romani principes ; and R. R. R. F. F. F. res Romana ruet ferro ſame, flamma.</p>
   <p>Uſed as a numeral, R anciently ſtood for So ; and with a daſh over it, thus R, for 80,000; but the Greek</p>
   <p>r, p, with a ſmall mark over it, ſignified 100; with the fame mark under it, it denoted 1000 X 100 ; thus p</p>
   <p>ſignified 100,000. In the Hebrew numeration n denoted 200 : and with two horizontal points over it 1000 X 200 ; thus n = 200,000.</p>
   <p>In the preſcriptions of phyſcians, R or R ſtands for recipe, i, e. “ take."</p>

               
   <p><h3>RAAB</h3>, a town of Lower Hungary, capital of Javérin, with a caſtle and a biſhop's fee. It is a ſtrong frontier bulwark againſt the Turks, and has two bridges, one over a double ditch, and another that leads towards Alba Regalis. The Surrounding country is plain, and there</p>
   <p>there is nothing that ſeems to command it but a ſmall hill at ſome diſtance, which is undermined and may be blown up. It was taken by Amurath III with the loſs of 20,000 men; but was ſurpriſed ſoon after by Count Palfi, who killed all the Turks that were found therein. It is ſeated at the confluence of the rivers Rab and Rabnitz, not far from the Danube, 32 miles weſt of Gran, and 55 ſouth-eaſt of Vienna. E. Long. 17. 25. N. Lat. 47. 48,</p>
